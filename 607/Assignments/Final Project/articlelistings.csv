"1","Is climate change causing Europe’s intense heat? A scientist weighs in","Science News talks with climate scientist Karsten Haustein about attributing extreme heat events in Europe and South Asia to climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-heat-wave","Mainland Europe has sweltered for days under record-breaking temperatures, prompting researchers to try to untangle how much of the heat wave can be linked to climate change. A report on that, by an international consortium of scientists called the World Weather Attribution Network, is expected to be released on July 2. Previous heat records for many parts of Europe were set in the summer of 2003, when temperatures soared to 44.1° Celsius (111.4° Fahrenheit) in the southern French town of Conqueyrac. That extreme heat killed more than 70,000 people across the continent — a death toll  that researchers determined was amplified by climate change (SN: 9/3/16, p. 5). Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox As another heat wave in 2018 baked Europe for three months, the consortium conducted a rapid assessment that determined it could not have happened without anthropogenic, or human-caused, climate change. Such events could occur yearly if global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the researchers found. If global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, though, such events were predicted every two out of three years. This year’s event, which began in mid-June, is expected to be shorter. But it is intense. On June 28, temperatures in Gallargues-le-Montueux, a city in southern France, hit 45.9° C (114.6° F), smashing temperature records for the country. But Europe isn’t the only part of the world dealing with dangerous heat levels. India and Pakistan have been suffering since mid-May under one of the longest-lasting heat waves in its recent history. In June, temperatures in New Delhi soared to 48° C (118.4° F), the highest ever recorded for the month in the Indian capital. By June 21, at least 180 people reportedly had died from heat-related causes. Science News spoke with Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford in England who is affiliated with the consortium, about what’s behind these deadly events and how scientists determine in real time whether a particular heat wave can be attributed to climate change. His comments have been edited for clarity and brevity. SN: Why was the World Weather Attribution Network created? Haustein: The idea was that we would look at any given extreme events while they’re happening and try to scientifically attribute the climate change factor. For example, has it become a more likely event or not [due to climate change]? We define the event, put it into historic context — for example, is it a 1-in-100-year event? — and determine if it’s setting records or getting media attention. And then we do the model analyses to isolate the climate signal. We’re also teaching other researchers, in places including Kenya, South Africa and Australia, how to use our methods. SN: Why are you analyzing the current Europe heat wave? Haustein: This current heat wave just started 10 days ago. [By June 24], it was already shaping up to be pretty extreme, so we went for it. The all-time maximum temperature in France was 44.1° C, from August 2003. That was a really bad one. There are chances we’ll get up to 45° C, which would be quite a new record. [A few hours after this interview, that milestone was reached on June 28.] For June, that’s pretty epic. Germany’s temperatures will peak on Sunday [June 30], and probably Monday [July 1] in Austria. And then there are two cold fronts that will be pushing through. SN: What atmospheric conditions are causing the intense heat? Haustein: To get a heat wave going, you need warm air in the upper level [of the atmosphere]. That comes from the south, from Africa. We actually set a record [on June 27] for temperatures at 1.5 kilometers above Earth’s surface, reaching 25.5° C. How those upper-level air masses translate into temperatures on the surface is a different story. In simple terms, the jet stream where it sits across Europe divides colder air in the north from warmer air in the south. Sometimes [this fast current of air above the Northern Hemisphere] becomes very wiggly, with big loops going far to the north and all the way down to northern Africa. That can transport really hot air from Africa to Europe. If it sits over Europe for several days, it can heat the surface. What’s causing that wiggly jet stream is contentious. Some people have suggested it’s linked to increasing temperatures in the Arctic. But we don’t really know. All we can say is that, over the last 10 days, there’s been a tendency to have this pattern: We see the jet stream digging farther south, and Europe is sitting in this warm air. Extreme temperatures scorched much of India and Pakistan from mid-May through June 2019. NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System, a global atmospheric climate simulation, created this map of air temperatures across the region on June 10. Several factors contributed to the heat wave, including a delayed monsoon. The health impacts of South Asia’s rising temperatures are unclear, though, due to other factors that can impact health, including higher humidity and air pollution levels in the region. And it’s also not yet clear if the region has been seeing an overall trend of increasing maximum air temperatures since the 1970s. NASA Earth Observatory SN: What about the heat wave in South Asia?  Haustein: As far as climate attribution, it’s similar to work we did on the 2016 heat wave in India. [That heat wave included a record-breaking temperature of 51° C in the western state of Rajasthan.] India’s 2019 temperatures appear to be due to natural year-to-year variability. We did a brief analysis that found that maximum temperatures across India in the hottest months aren’t clearly increasing. SN: What did the consortium learn in analyzing the 2018 European heat wave? Haustein: We know that the frequency and intensity of heat waves are increasing globally. Heat waves in Europe, such as the one in 2018, are at least twice as likely to occur now as a result of climate change."
"2","Why this warmer world is not just a passing phase","Editor in Chief Nancy Shute discusses climate change and the uncertainty of science.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-warmer-world-not-just-passing-phase","In the late 1990s, three scientists published a paper charting the Earth’s temperatures over the last millennium. For the first 900 years, the trend line was the definition of boring: just little blips up and down. That changed around 1900, when the mean global temperature shot up, and kept rising. That now-famous trend line, dubbed “the hockey stick” because of its sharp upward slope, is so vivid that it has played a key role in two decades of argument over whether the Earth’s atmosphere is warming, and whether those changes are caused by heat-trapping gases generated by human activities.  It’s not hard to pick apart a single study’s data. Critics of the hockey stick pointed to centuries-long temperature shifts such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age to argue that anomalies in the 20th century were also short-term, natural shifts. Critics also noted the patchwork nature of the pre-1900 data, which didn’t rely on direct measurements, and said there was no direct evidence that increased greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels was causing the current temperature rise. Uncertainty is central to the enterprise of science. It’s a rare day when a single study — or dozens, or hundreds — answers a question without a doubt. And because uncertainty almost always remains, scientists have to explain both quantitatively and qualitatively how uncertain they are. That’s good science. But climate change naysayers used that uncertainty to say, “The scientists aren’t sure.” And it meant that when we journalists reported accurately on the science by noting uncertainty, we gave more ammunition to doubters. Well, scientists are now sure. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international consortium convened by the United Nations to evaluate the science of climate, released a report saying there was greater than 95 percent certainty that the substantial warming was due to human activities. And scientists are increasingly linking extreme weather events worldwide, from heat waves to hurricanes, to human-caused climate change (SN: 1/19/19, p. 7). In this issue, we report on how the city of Boston is regularly flooding due to rising sea levels. Freelancer Mary Caperton Morton explains how policy makers and scientists are racing to develop responses to keep the venerable city functioning as the water moves inland. And earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling reports on a startling new study that lays to rest the argument that the warming we’re experiencing is just another normal climate shift. This one is clearly different, the data show: Those earlier temperature fluctuations were regional; what’s happening now is worldwide.  Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State who is one of the researchers who developed the hockey stick data chart, said back in 2005 that he thought that people wouldn’t take climate change seriously until they saw it in their own backyards. People in Boston think they’re seeing it, as do people in many other communities around the world who are bracing for more extreme heat, rainfall, drought and storms. Our charge at Science News is to continue to report on the science while chronicling humankind’s responses, for good or ill. "
"3","How climate change is already altering oceans and ice, and what’s to come","A new IPCC report gives the lowdown on how climate change is already wreaking havoc on Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, and how much worse things could get.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future","Polar caps quickly
losing ice. Chalky coral reefs. Stronger storms that devastate islands and
cities, claiming lives and destroying homes. Those aren’t
speculations about what our world faces in a warmer future. Those are climate
change impacts happening now — and set to worsen, according to a new report by
the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The report, a summary of which was released on September 25, is the panel’s first comprehensive update on how human-driven climate change is upsetting Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, or cryosphere. Just how severe things get will depend on whether countries rein in climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, or continue pumping them into the atmosphere.  The report focuses
on forecasts for two potential scenarios: One involves curbing carbon emissions
to limit global warming to around 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
(The world is already more than halfway there, having warmed by 1.1 degrees C since 1900, according to a report by the World
Meteorological Organization published September 22.) In another, high-emissions
scenario, pollution continues apace, potentially warming the world by about 4
degrees C.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Science News took a look at the report’s predictions for how changes to
Earth’s oceans and ice will impact societies and our natural world, along with
the latest science on where things stand today.  Already, glaciers and ice sheets are
shrinking, and some are shrinking fast. The Greenland ice sheet lost an average
278 billion tons of ice per year from 2006 to 2015. That amount of water alone is
enough to cause average global sea levels to rise about 0.77 millimeters per
year. And on July 31, a record-breaking 57 percent of the sheet showed signs of melting (SN: 8/2/19). Meanwhile, the Antarctic ice
sheet lost an average 155 billion tons per year, or roughly enough to raise
seas by an average 0.43 millimeters per year (SN: 6/13/18).  Glaciers from the Himalayas to Chile and Canada on average have lost 220 billion
tons per year (SN: 4/6/15),
threatening the safety and livelihoods of millions of people who rely on melt water to meet
their water needs (SN:
6/19/19). Greenland and Antarctica have dominated ice
melt contributing to rising sea levels. Even with global action against climate
change, the two massive ice sheets are still expected to contribute a combined
11 centimeters or so of sea level rise by 2100. But without that effort, average
sea levels could rise up to some 27 centimeters by 2100 just from the melting
in Greenland and Antarctica, the IPCC report says.  Glaciers could add nine to 20 centimeters to
that rise, depending on emissions. And regions with mostly smaller glaciers, like
Central Europe, Scandinavia and the Andes, could lose more than 80 percent of
their current ice mass by the end of the century if emissions continue business-as-usual. Glacier
runoff, regardless of emissions scenarios, would peak by the end of the century
and then decline, potentially leaving less water available for future generations.
 Aside from the ice that sits atop mountains
and landmasses, thick ice blankets the Arctic Sea, with more expansive coverage
in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter. Scientists say the white ice plays an
important role in reflecting sunlight away from Earth, which keeps the Arctic
from getting too hot. But that ice is
shrinking. Although the sea ice
expands and contracts over the course of a year, the overall amount of ice has
steadily declined since 1979, the IPCC
says.  So much melting has left little ice that has
endured for at least five years (such hardened ice is expected to be sturdier
than single-season ice). In fact, as of last year, the fraction of sea ice
older than five years had declined by about 90 percent since 1979, the report
says. In Antarctica, meanwhile, there’s still a lot
of uncertainty about the state of sea ice now and in the future (SN: 6/27/17).  The lid of sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean (which expands in the winter and contracts in the summer) has been steadily shrinking, satellite records show. The 2019 minimum extent, reached September 18, is tied with two other years for the second lowest amount of ice cover: 4.15 million square kilometers. In a low-emissions scenario that limits global
warming to 1.5 degrees C, the probability of September being ice free after the
summertime melt is a mere 1 percent. But at 2 degree C warming, that risk jumps
to 10 to 35 percent. The loss of sea ice takes away habitat for Arctic mammals
and birds. And less ice also means more exposed water, which is dark and
absorbs more sunshine.  Permanently frozen soil, which has carbon trapped
in the ground, is warming to record levels, increasing an average of 0.29
degrees Celsius from 2007 to 2016, the IPCC says. Arctic and other northern permafrost
is estimated to contain almost twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere. A
thaw in permafrost could release trapped carbon dioxide and methane into the air
— though it’s not yet certain if that’s
happening today (SN: 12/19/16).  But thaw it will, the report says. By 2100,
the expanse of Earth’s permafrost could decrease by around 24 percent in a
low-emissions scenario, or 69 percent in a high-emissions future. Under that
scenario, permafrost could exhale tens to hundreds of billions of tons of
carbon, in the form of CO2 and methane, into the atmosphere by 2100,
possibly making global warming even worse. Thawed regions might see more plant
growth, pulling some of that carbon back into the soil — but not nearly enough
to make up for carbon releases. So far, oceans have swallowed up
more than 90 percent of the climate’s excess heat, and as a result have been
warming up. Marine heat waves, which scorch coral reefs (SN: 1/4/18) and help boost the frequency of toxic algal blooms (SN: 8/28/18), are getting more severe and lasting longer
than they did decades ago (SN: 4/10/18).
And human-caused climate change may have been responsible for nearly 90 percent
of these events between 2006 and 2015, the IPCC says.  Those hot waters — which will get even hotter
under any emissions scenario — are also helping to drive many ocean-dwelling
animals to move toward cooler digs near the poles (SN: 5/2/18). But in
new environments, migrant animals can interfere with local food webs (SN: 2/2/15). Climate-driven shifts in ocean species may have already hurt overall catch potential for
the world’s fisheries (SN: 2/28/19). By 2100, ocean surfaces are expected to absorb
five to seven times more heat than they have since 1970 under a high-emissions
scenario. And heat waves would be 50 times more frequent than they were in 1900.
In a low-emissions scenario, heat waves would be 20 times more frequent by 2100
than in 1900.   It’s not just heat that oceans take in. The
world’s biggest water bodies also have absorbed an estimated 20 to 30 percent
of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere since the 1980s, causing
seawater to become more acidic (SN: 4/28/17). That’s going to continue, the IPCC says. In a high-emissions scenario, the pH of the ocean surface is expected to drop by around 0.3 pH points (on a scale of 14) by the end of the century. That acidity may make it more difficult for creatures like snails, crabs and shrimps to build their shells and impairs the function of tiny algae that ferry carbon to the deep ocean. Acidity can also deplete seawater of the minerals that corals use to build their exoskeletons (SN: 2/23/16).  Sea levels are rising faster with time. And that swell is going to continue under any emissions scenario, the IPCC says. From 2006 to 2015, sea level rose about  3.6 millimeters per year, about 2.5 times as fast as sea level rise from 1901 to 1990. Melting ice sheets and glaciers are primarily to blame. With higher sea levels come greater flooding and coastal
erosion. Encroaching seawater can also shrink habitats and force species along
coastlines to relocate — if they can. (SN:
8/6/19). Nearly half of coastal wetlands already have
disappeared over the last century, due partly to higher seawater.  In a low-emissions future, sea level rise
could reach an average 4 millimeters per year in 2100, compared with 15
millimeters per year in a high-emissions future. Higher sea levels are also
affecting the risk of certain disasters, such as coastal flooding. Extreme
events related to high seas that were once rare — happening once a century — could
happen at least once per year in many places by 2050, especially in the
tropics. That puts coastal areas and small islands
in even greater danger (SN: 8/15/18).  Human-driven climate change has likely increased
the amount of wind and rain associated with some tropical cyclones already (SN: 9/13/18).
These storms will probably get more intense, with bigger storm surges and more
rainfall, even if emissions are limited. Scientists aren’t yet sure whether
tropical cyclones will become more frequent, though.  What could become more frequent, and possibly less predicable (SN: 8/21/19), are extreme El Niño and La Niña events (SN: 1/26/15). Extreme El Niños may hit twice as often in this century compared with the last, the report says. These weather disturbances are also expected to become more hazardous, causing dryer droughts and more torrential downpours around the world. "
"4","Climate change could raise the risk of deadly fungal infections in humans","The rise of Candida auris, a deadly fungus spurring outbreaks in the United States and worldwide, may have been aided by climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans","While fungal diseases have devastated many animal and plant species, humans and other mammals have mostly been spared. That’s probably because mammals have body temperatures too warm for most fungi to replicate as well as powerful immune systems. But climate change may be challenging those defenses, bringing new fungal threats to human health, a microbiologist warns. From 2012 to 2015, pathogenic versions of the fungus Candida auris arose independently in Africa, Asia and South America. The versions are from the same species, yet they are genetically distinct, so the spread across continents couldn’t have been caused by infected travelers, says Arturo Casadevall of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Instead, each continents’ C. auris may have become tolerant of the average normal body temperature of humans — about 37° Celsius — because the fungi acclimated to warming in the environment caused by climate change, Casadevall and colleagues argue. If this hypothesis turns out to be true, C. auris “may be the first example of a new fungal disease emerging from climate change” that poses a risk to humans, the researchers report online July 23 in mBio.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox New York, New Jersey and Illinois currently have the highest number of confirmed cases of C. auris in the country.  Confirmed cases of Candida auris in the United States as of May 31 Since mid-2016, when reporting of C. auris infections began in the United States, there have been nearly 700 cases confirmed in 12 states, with deadly outbreaks occurring among patients in hospitals and other health care facilities. More than 30 countries around the world have also reported cases. The fungus causes dangerous infections of the blood, brain, heart and other parts of the body. Studies show that an invasive infection can be fatal 30 to 60 percent of the time. And some infections are resistant to all available antifungal medications. Hospitalized patients tend to have weakened immune systems. But C. auris wouldn’t have been a health concern without first developing the ability to replicate inside people, Casadevall says, and it had to become more tolerant of warmer temperatures to do that. Past work has shown a fungus can be coaxed to grow at warmer temperatures in a laboratory setting. “There are millions of fungal species out there,” Casadevall says. “As they adapt to a warmer climate, some of them will then have the capacity to breach our thermal defenses.” Meanwhile, other fungi are wreaking destruction on many animals and plants, including frogs (SN: 4/27/19, p. 5), snakes (SN: 1/20/18, p. 16) and trees (SN: 5/3/03, p. 282). “A lot of our fellow creatures are being wiped out,” Casadevall says. And while mammals have tended to be “remarkably resistant to invasive fungal diseases,” he says, bats have been hit hard by outbreaks of a fungus that causes white nose syndrome in part because their body temperature drops during hibernation (SN Online: 7/15/19). “The fungal kingdom is just so vast,” Casadevall says. If another fungus dangerous to humans can evolve to “defeat our thermal barrier, who knows what it will do to us?”"
"5","50 years ago, scientists puzzled over a slight global cooling","Five decades ago, scientists were puzzled over a slight dip in global temperatures. Today we know it was just a blip, and that Earth’s climate is warming thanks to industrial activity over the last century.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-puzzled-over-slight-global-cooling","Earth’s cooling climate, Science News, November 15, 1969 — The average temperature for the entire Earth rose gradually from the 1880s until the early 1940s. At that time, a cooling trend suddenly set in which is continuing today.… The amount of dust and other particulate matter in the atmosphere has increased dramatically in recent decades, a change that could counteract the thermal effect of carbon dioxide buildup. From 1940 to about 1975, the average global surface temperature decreased by about 0.1 degrees Celsius, interrupting a decades-long warming trend even as carbon emissions continued to rise. Many scientists thought the cooling trend was possibly caused by sulfate particles from the burning of fossil fuels that can scatter sunlight and reduce atmospheric warming (SN: 11/21/09, p. 5). That hunch proved correct: When the United States and other countries began to lower sulfur emissions in the 1970s to reduce acid rain and respiratory illnesses, the cooling ended abruptly. Since 1975, the average global temperature has risen by about 0.6 degrees C. Today, the average surface temperature is 1.1 degrees C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times (SN: 9/25/19). However, ongoing sulfate emissions, particularly from China and India, may still be slowing greenhouse gas-driven warming. Removing all aerosol emissions from the world at once could add about 0.7 degrees C to global temperatures. "
"6","Climate change may be throwing coral sex out of sync","Several widespread corals in the Red Sea are flubbing cues to spawn en masse.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-throwing-coral-sex-out-sync","Bad timing for coral sex might be an underappreciated threat of climate change.  Spawning is out of sync for at least three widespread coral species in the Red Sea, says Tom Shlesinger, a marine biologist at Tel Aviv University. And warmer seawater temperatures could be playing a role.   Records from the 1980s suggest that whole swaths of corals from particular species typically let colorful egg-sperm bundles float out of their tiny mouths and up into the water on the same few nights a year, Shlesinger says. Released in a big synchronized cloud, the sex cells separate from one another, gaining a chance at fertilization during the brief time that they survive on their own in seawater. It’s “a wonder of nature,” he says. But after four years of recent monitoring, Shlesinger argues that three of the five species studied no longer tightly synchronize their species-wide gamete releases. And few if any new colonies of these kinds of corals are showing up in recent surveys, so the species might dwindle away in the region, Shlesinger and Yossi Loya, also at Tel Aviv University, warn in the Sept. 6 Science.  Shlesinger didn’t set out to compare local spawning synchrony. But “it’s something that kind of grabbed me,” he says. After realizing some corals weren’t spawning when expected, “I started going to the sea at night.”  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox By the second year of his questing, he was snorkeling or diving several hours a night during spawning months. Some 150 species of corals mingle in the long, narrow gulf of the Red Sea that stretches northeast past Eilat in Israel and Aqaba in Jordan. Unlike the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, where more than 100 coral species can release their gametes together on the same night, the Red Sea’s corals spawn one species or a few at a time on their own special nights.  Shlesinger had seen corals spawn elsewhere, but the night he finally got the timing right to catch an event in the Red Sea was “magical,” he says. He first spotted small, red egg-sperm bundles drifting up from a single coral. Soon he was swimming through “a colorful snowstorm” of little red capsules rising from hundreds or even thousands of corals.  A whole species can synchronize its spawning to the same half-hour. That precision depends on an interlocking set of environmental cues. Water temperature, sunlight and wind affect the month of the event, researchers have found. The phase of the moon matters in determining the night, and local sunset cues the time.  Data from 1980 to 1982 on the five studied species show consistent, synchronous patterns of mass spawning, based on regular lab exams of coral samples plus nighttime swims. But during 225 swim surveys from 2015 through 2018, Shlesinger discovered that only two of the five species still managed to spawn en masse during just a few nights. Three others didn’t synchronize tightly. In 2018, for instance, at least a few big lumps of the brain coral Platygyra lamellina spawned just about every night from June 12 to July 18. Mini releases don’t create a thick enough soup of gametes to make fertilization likely or for there to be a lot left over after fish finish feasting on the bundles.  The moon still waxes and wanes regularly, but other spawning cues may be wavering out of sync with it. For instance, since 1982, when the earlier surveys were conducted, water in the northern part of the gulf has warmed about 0.31 degrees Celsius per decade, the researchers calculate. (Pollutants, especially hormone-disrupting ones, might also be sabotaging coral reproduction, the scientists say.) Corals around the world are already threatened by rising temperatures, which can cause corals to severely bleach and die (SN: 1/4/18), among other threats. Various efforts are under way to help rehab and protect these spectacular ecosystems (SN: 10/18/16).  Biologists have certainly fretted that climate change might also knock coral spawning synchrony askew, says James Guest, a coral biologist at Newcastle University in England. It’s not easy finding old records with methods comparable with today’s, however. For instance, older data might have missed some of the smaller blips in synchrony that showed up in Shlesinger’s diligent swimming, Guest says.   And some corals have a bit of natural play in their timing, says Taryn Foster, a coral biologist at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. In her work off the coast of Australia, she’s found that corals in Scott Reef observe a sort of leap year. Every two or three seasons, they split their spawning into two separate bursts, thus coping with the way moon phases cycle faster than annual cues. These corals, however, break their spawning into roughly equal parts. It’s the small bursts of spawning described in the new study that she worries about. That’s the menace to the three corals, Shlesinger says. In five sample plots in each of two areas at Eilat that he monitored, some other species were doing well, but he struggled to find youngsters for the three out-of-sync coral species. For two of them, he often found no new youngsters at all. "
"7","Drug-resistant microbes kill about 35,000 people in the U.S. per year","The latest CDC report on drug-resistant microbes finds that these pathogens infect close to 3 million people in the United States each year.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-drug-resistant-microbes-kill-about-35000-people-united-states-per-year","Close to 3 million people in the United States develop difficult to treat infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria and fungi each year — and about 35,000 die, according to a new government report. “The modern medicine
available to us today may very well be gone tomorrow if we don’t slow the
development of antibiotic resistance,” said Robert Redfield, director of the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, during a news
briefing on November 13.  In its first report on drug-resistant infections in six years, the CDC revised its 2013 report using newly available data including electronic health records from over 700 hospitals. The number of annual deaths from drug-resistant infections at that time is now estimated to have been around 44,000 — almost double the 23,000 deaths previously estimated.  The new report also estimates that currently about 35,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections, reflecting an 18 percent decrease from the revised number of the 2013 report. That shows there’s been progress in reducing the spread of drug-resistant microbes typically associated with hospitals, a major source of deaths, said Michael Craig, a senior advisor on antimicrobial resistance at the CDC, during the news briefing.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Even with the additional
data, however, the CDC considers its estimates conservative. In a letter
published in Infection Control &
Hospital Epidemiology in 2019, researchers from Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis, using different methodologies, estimate that more than 150,000 people in the United States died from drug-resistant microbes in 2010. “The CDC’s new numbers represent excellent progress in
assessing the burden of antibiotic resistance, but they still likely
underestimate its vast impact,” says Greg Frank, director of infectious disease
policy for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry group in
Washington, D.C. Deaths due to drug-resistant microbes are often underreported
because many patients with these infections also have other health issues that
could get recorded as the cause of death, he says. The latest report also adds two new drug-resistant organisms to the CDC’s list of bacteria and fungi that the agency considers urgent public health threats. The fungus Candida auris and bacteria Acinetobacter that are resistant to the antibiotic carbapenem join the bacteria Clostridioides difficile, drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to carbapenem on the list.  N. gonorrhoeae causes
the common, sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea and can cause infertility in women (SN:
12/9/02). Acinetobacter spreads mainly in health care facilities, causing
pneumonia and urinary tract infections.  C. auris, which
causes severe and often fatal infections in hospitalized patients, is “a pathogen that we didn’t even
know about when we put out the last report in 2013,” Craig said. “Since then,
it has circumnavigated the globe and has caused a lot of infections and
deaths.” Its quick rise from a medically unknown fungus to worldwide health threat
may be due to climate change, according to one theory (SN: 7/26/19). "
"8","Climate change may make El Niño and La Niña less predictable","Atlantic Niñas and Niños have been fairly reliable bellwethers for severe El Niño and La Niña events in the Pacific. A warming world may change that.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-may-make-el-nino-la-nina-less-predictable","Climate change may
make it harder
to predict the most severe of the El Niño and La Niña weather disturbances
in the Pacific Ocean. That’s because these events will become less connected
with what happens halfway around the world in the Atlantic, researchers report
online August 21 in Science Advances.
 In today’s climate, cooling in the waters of the equatorial Atlantic, called an Atlantic Niña, can lead to especially warm water in the equatorial Pacific, or El Niño (SN: 5/28/16, p. 13). Meanwhile, warmer Atlantic Niño waters tend to give rise to the cooler waters of La Niña in the Pacific. That call-and-response relationship, which involves air being swept into the atmosphere from over the Atlantic and settling down over the Pacific, can give forecasters an edge in anticipating destructive El Niño and La Niña events.  But as the atmosphere
gets warmer, that gas exchange is expected to become more sluggish, weakening the
Atlantic’s sway over the Pacific. Future El Niños and La Niñas may not follow
the Atlantic events as reliably as in the past, new simulations suggest. That could
make it harder to prepare for especially disruptive El Niño
and La Niña episodes, which can incite flooding in some regions while drying
up others or making hurricanes stronger (SN
Online: 11/10/16). Researchers gauged
just how reliably Atlantic Niñas and Niños have been bellwethers for El Niños
and La Niñas in the past by comparing the patterns of these events over the last
several decades. The team found that the strongest El Niños and La Niñas —
including the 1998 La Niña that caused floods in China and hurricanes in the
Caribbean, killing tens of thousands of people — were almost always preceded by
Atlantic events. Computer simulations revealed
how the Atlantic-Pacific relationship might change if climate-warming carbon emissions
continue to rise throughout the 21st century. The simulations suggest that,
while future extreme El Niño and La Niña events are expected
to happen more frequently, only about half of these events will be
foreshadowed by Atlantic events (SN Online: 1/26/15).  So “it’s going to be
harder to predict the Pacific extreme El Niño and extreme La Niña,” says study
coauthor Wenju Cai, a climate scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization in Aspendale, Australia. These findings, while plausible, “must be interpreted with some caution” because computer simulations don’t perfectly emulate ocean-atmosphere interactions, says climate scientist Maria Belen Rodriguez-Fonseca of the Complutense University of Madrid. If future Atlantic Niños and Niñas aren’t as useful for predicting Pacific activity, “it’s not going to be catastrophic,” she says. The Atlantic Ocean is but one element among many environmental factors, such as conditions in the Pacific and Indian oceans, that feed into forecasts for these meteorological juggernauts.  "

The high-altitude Himalayan country was typically too chilly for the disease-carrying insects to live. But with climate change opening new paths for the viral disease, Nepal is now reeling from an unprecedented outbreak.  At least 9,000 people — from 65 of Nepal’s 77
districts — have been diagnosed with dengue since August, including six
patients who have died, according to government health data.  “We have never had an outbreak like this
before,” says Dr. Basu Dev Pandey, director of the Sukraraj Tropical and
Infectious Diseases Hospital in the nation’s capital, Kathmandu. With dozens of
people lined up for blood testing on September 26 at the nearby fever clinic,
set up this year to handle the outbreak, Pandey continues: “People are afraid.”
 Dengue is carried by the Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes,
and has long been associated with warmer, low-lying tropical climates where the
insects thrive. But for years, researchers have warned that dengue and other
mosquito-borne illnesses would spread into new regions, as climate change
brings warmer temperatures and alters rainfall patterns so that cooler regions
become more hospitable for mosquitoes (SN:
9/15/11).  Nepal is proving to be a real-world example of
this change. The country had its first-ever
dengue outbreak in 2006, but only a handful of people were affected that year
from lowland districts along the southern border with India.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox “Climate
change has created the conditions for the transmission of dengue at higher
elevations,” says Meghnath Dhimal,
chief research officer at the Nepal Health Research Council, a government
agency based in Kathmandu. Atmospheric temperatures in the Himalayan Mountains
have been increasing by an average of 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. So across
Nepal, there are increasingly more days each year that fall into the ideal
temperature range for A. aegypti of
20° to 30° Celsius, Dhimal says. Areas like the capital are having fewer summer nights and days
below 15° C, around where mosquitoes tend to stop feeding. Nepal also saw its
heaviest monsoon rainfall in a decade in July, with severe flooding reported
across the country. Floods typically lead to the pooling of stagnant water,
prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In recent years, the country started spraying insecticide to control mosquito populations in Kathmandu,
which sits in a mountain valley about 1,400 meters above sea level.  The disease, which had caused severe outbreaks
in only nine countries before 1970, is now endemic in more than 100 countries, according to
the World Health Organization. An estimated 390 million people
worldwide get dengue infections every year, with about a quarter developing
symptoms, researchers said in a 2013 paper in Nature. Some of that spread is
explained by urbanization as well as global travel and trade. But studies show
that atmospheric temperatures are the most important drivers for dengue distribution and risk, followed by rainfall patterns, according to a
2016 review paper in Environmental
Research.   With climate change,
“warmer temperatures can affect both the mosquito and the virus,” says coauthor
Kristie Ebi, a public health expert at the University of Washington in Seattle.
A hotter climate helps mosquito larvae develop faster into adulthood, while
also increasing the rate at which the dengue virus replicates within the
mosquito, she says.  “There seems to be
dengue outbreaks worldwide this year,” Ebi says. In August, for example, the
Philippines declared a national emergency after dengue killed some 300 people
and was suspected of sickening another 77,000 in the first 20 weeks of 2019 —
almost double the number of cases reported during the same period the previous
year in the Southeast Asian island nation.  And worldwide, it’s only
going to get worse, according to a study published June 10 in Nature Microbiology. In that work,
researchers built a map of global dengue distribution in 2015, and then
predicted how climate change as well as socioeconomic and population trends
would make new areas suitable for dengue transmission. By 2050, those areas would include cities in coastal
China and Japan, southern Africa and the southeastern United States,
epidemiologist Janey Messina at the University of Oxford and her colleagues
find.  Similar trends also are
expected — if not already seen — for other insect-driven viral diseases,
including West Nile virus (SN: 11/28/18), chikungunya (SN: 6/2/15) and tick-borne Lyme disease
(SN: 8/9/17).  Scientists have been working to develop a vaccine against dengue
(SN: 6/15/16), but there is still no
proven cure. Doctors can only ease symptoms that include
headache, high fever, severe muscle pain, nausea and skin rash. Without
treatment for symptoms, the disease can be deadly, killing roughly 20,000 people a year, according
to WHO. Even with treatment, people are typically sick and unable to work for
several weeks if not months. "
"10","Climate misinformation may be thriving on YouTube, a social scientist warns","Analyzing 200 climate-related videos on YouTube shows that a majority challenge widely accepted views about climate change and climate engineering.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-misinformation-may-be-thriving-youtube-social-scientist-warns","Beware what you view about climate change on YouTube. Conspiracy theorists have hijacked some climate-related terms to spread misinformation on the online video-sharing website, a social scientist warns. He urges his colleagues to respond by getting accurate information about their work to science communicators on YouTube.  While Facebook and Twitter get the lion’s share of attention when it comes to concerns about fake news, Joachim Allgaier of RWTH Aachen University in Germany says YouTube is equally, if not more insidious, given its huge popularity. Allgaier, who focuses on how science is communicated online, initially researched science-themed music videos on the site. He found several on Darwin’s theory of evolution, one song about the periodic table by the band They Might Be Giants and a parody by an Alzheimer’s research team contorting the lyrics to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” to sing about being “caught in a bad project.” “I was amazed by the creativity,” Allgaier says. But he was also disturbed by music videos attacking established science. Those science skeptics questioned the fact that human activities are driving climate change, the use of chemotherapy to treat cancer and the safety of vaccines. So Allgaier decided to investigate what kind of YouTube videos he found when he searched the site using 10 different climate-related terms, including “climate change,” “global warming” and “climate science.” He also searched for “climate manipulation” and “geoengineering,” terms that refer to emerging large-scale technologies to cool the Earth and offset global warming, such as adding tiny, sunlight-blocking particles high in the stratosphere (SN: 11/28/15, p. 26). To prevent earlier searches from shaping the results of later searches, Allgaier obscured his IP address, location and search history. Then, he analyzed the top 20 videos for each of the 10 terms. Of those 200 videos, 89 support the established scientific premise that climate change is the result of human activities. But four feature neutral debates between scientists and climate change skeptics, and 16 deny that humans are causing climate change. Most strikingly, 91 videos promote conspiracy theories about climate change or climate engineering, particularly about so-called chemtrails, Allgaier reports July 25 in Frontiers in Communication. Chemtrailers believe politicians or government agents are spreading toxic chemicals through airplanes’ condensation trails — an idea unrelated to climate change, and not supported by science. Many people could view that misinformation, Allgaier warns. YouTube says that it reaches roughly 2 billion users each month, or about a third of all internet users — making it a powerful communication tool. A 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., questioned 4,581 adults in the United States from July 30 to August 12 and found that 21 percent of people get their news from YouTube. In Germany, over 70 percent of another survey’s respondents aged 14 to 29 reported using YouTube and other online video platforms to be informed about science. That survey, by Berlin-based science communications company Science in Dialogue, questioned 1,008 people from August 6 to August 13, 2018. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Allgaier also found that more common search terms like “climate change” and “global warming” typically lead to accurate videos. But newer terms like “geoengineering” and “climate modification” lead to those chemtrail videos almost 93 percent of the time. Some geoengineering ideas are perfect fodder for conspiracy theorists, especially ones that propose injecting particles into the atmosphere. Plus, geoengineering is a relatively new research area, and geoscientists have a minimal presence on YouTube, Allgaier says. That has enabled conspiracy theorists to hijack terms related to the technology through tactics like mirroring, where followers upload a video to multiple YouTube channels and tag each version with different keywords to dominate the online-video database. Other tactics include making it easier for people discover links to the conspiracy videos during searches through search engine optimization and commenting on legitimate science videos with links to conspiracy content.   Scientists and science communicators must flood YouTube with scientifically accurate content, and even mimic those conspiracy tactics, Allgaier argues, to reclaim scientific terms that have been highjacked. Otherwise, researchers risk ceding control of information about their work to the conspirators. “It’s necessary to take action,” he says."
"11","IPCC report warns of a bleak future for oceans and frozen regions under climate change","A new IPCC report offers dire warnings about how climate change is altering oceans, the polar regions and the high snowy mountains.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-report-climate-change-bleak-future-oceans-cryosphere-solutions","Earth’s oceans and frozen regions are changing alarmingly quickly, scientists warn in the first comprehensive look at how greenhouse gas emissions are altering the planet’s seas and cryosphere.  Since 1993, the rate of
warming in the oceans has more than doubled, scientists report in a new study
by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Melting of the
two great ice sheets blanketing Greenland and West Antarctica is speeding up as
well, accelerating sea level rise. And West Antarctica’s glaciers may already
be so unstable that they are past the point of no return. “The consequences for nature
and humanity are sweeping and severe,” Ko Barrett, IPCC vice-chair and head of
research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said at a news
conference September 24. Rising seas are already threatening low-lying coastal
areas that today are home to 680 million people, about 10 percent of the
world’s population.   The Sept. 25 release of a summary
of the report coincided with the U.N.
Climate Action Summit in New York City. And it came amidst a surge of global
protests, climate strikes and calls for nations around the world to
dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions in hopes of limiting future warming.
 Such action can’t come too soon, scientists say. Already, warming ocean waters are yielding fewer fish (SN: 2/28/19), and are fueling more intense, rainier tropical storms (SN: 9/28/18). Ocean heat waves are increasing, threatening corals and other sea life (SN: 4/10/18). Greenland (SN: 9/18/19) and the West Antarctic ice sheet (SN: 8/5/19) are rapidly shedding ice, accelerating sea level rise to a rate of 3.5 millimeters per year. And Arctic sea ice continues to dwindle (SN: 3/14/19); minimum sea-ice extent in 2019 tied with 2007 and 2016, according to data released by the National Snow and Ice Data Center on September 23. That’s the second-lowest extent on satellite record, after 2012. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox “The ocean has largely been
left out of the discussion on climate,” says Becca Gisclair, senior director of
Arctic Programs for the Ocean Conservancy in Bellingham, Wash., who was not
involved in the IPCC study. The new report emphasizes the need to “slash
emissions, and do it quickly, or these impacts highlighted in the report will
quickly become irreversible…. My hope is that seeing all of these impacts in
one place can highlight the need for action.” The extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean reached its minimum for the year — 4.15 million square kilometers — on September 18, tying for the second lowest minimum in the satellite record with 2007 and 2016. The lowest measured sea ice extent was in 2012. The report is one of several
special reports focusing on the latest science on specific aspects of climate
change that the IPCC releases in between its large, sweeping assessments. Since
the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report came out in 2013, scientists have learned a
great deal about the impacts of absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide on the
oceans and their denizens, as well as in coastal areas, says Sarah Cooley,
director of the Ocean Conservancy’s ocean acidification program in Washington,
D.C. For this new report, 104 scientists from 36 countries evaluated 6,981
studies to determine the impact on the world’s oceans and ice-covered regions.  While the IPCC report rings
an alarm bell, there is hope, says climate scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, who
heads the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia.
The ocean isn’t just part of the problem, Hoegh-Guldberg says — it should be a
key part of the solution. “What’s surprising is how quickly we can limit the
damage,” Hoegh-Guldberg says, a message that he says was also embedded within the
IPCC’s 2018 special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius of
warming, for which he was a
contributing author (SN: 12/17/18).  Hoegh-Guldberg and
colleagues recently assessed ways to harness ocean resources to reduce or
mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. The study, commissioned by a group of
15 world leaders called the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, was released September 23 by the World Resources
Institute. In it, the researchers highlight five ocean-related activities that they say can help slow warming: Those five activities have the potential to account for as much as 21 percent of the emissions reductions needed by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times by the end of the century, Hoegh-Guldberg and colleagues write in the Sept. 27 Science. That help is sorely needed. Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1.1 degrees C, and studies suggest that global emissions are now on track to blow past midcentury targets needed to achieve 1.5 degrees (SN: 7/1/19).   Taken together, the two new
studies provide “a nice point-counterpoint,” says Jane Lubchenco, a marine
biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Lubchenco, who ran NOAA from
2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, is a co-chair of the High Level
Panel’s expert group of researchers and policy analysts. The IPCC special
report “shines a very bright spotlight on the ocean as a victim,” Lubchenco
says. “But it is also a powerful source of solutions.”  None of these potential
solutions are new concepts, but there has been little political will to invest
in the necessary research and development to move them forward, Hoegh-Guldberg says.
These actions may finally get some traction in December, when nations head to
Santiago, Chile, for COP25, the annual meeting to review progress of the U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change.  At the COP21 meeting in Paris in December 2015, 195 nations signed on to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, pledging to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep global warming to “well below” 2 degrees C above preindustrial times (SN: 12/12/15). The United States was one of the signing nations, but President Donald Trump has said he plans to withdraw the country from the accord in 2020 (SN: 6/1/17). Chile President Sebastián
Piñera has said COP25 will be the “Blue COP,” emphasizing the central role that
he expects ocean economies to play in the discussions. The U.N. climate meeting
in December is also a prelude to a 2020 deadline for Paris Agreement
signatories to submit revised and increasingly ambitious plans to reduce their
emissions.  Ocean-based mitigation
solutions could become a big part of those plans, Gisclair says. “There is a
big opportunity there for countries to make new climate commitments that
include the ocean.”"
"12","Hurricane Dorian’s slow pace makes it dangerous and hard to predict","Hurricane Dorian is one of several recent hurricanes that moved extremely slowly. Whether that's due to climate change isn't yet clear.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricane-dorian-slow-pace-dangerous-predictions-hard","Hurricane Dorian has been a
slow, near-record-breaking, rough beast of a storm. After more than 24 hours of
hovering over the northern Bahamas and pummeling the islands with wind, rain
and surging seas, Dorian finally got moving again on September 3. It slouched
northward toward the U.S. coast as a category 2 hurricane, with sustained winds
of about 177 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour). The second-strongest
Atlantic hurricane on record (and strongest outside the tropics), Dorian made
landfall in the Bahamas on September 1 as a powerful category 5 storm, with
sustained winds of about 298 kilometers per hour (185 miles per hour). The
hurricane’s fury was dangerous enough, but then it practically stopped — shifting a mere 40 kilometers as it churned over the
Caribbean nation. That’s the second slowest trek for an Atlantic hurricane
after 1965’s Hurricane Betsy, a category 4 storm. That snail’s pace has stymied
forecasters trying to determine the storm’s path as it heads toward the United
States.  Dorian’s slog makes it one
of several strong but lethargic cyclones in recent decades, a trend that includes
2017’s Hurricane Harvey (SN: 9/28/18), 2018’s Hurricane Florence (SN: 9/13/18) and Cyclone
Idai, which struck Mozambique in March. In fact, over the last 70 years, cyclones
around the globe have been slowing down, James Kossin, a climate scientist with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is based in Madison, Wisc.,
found in 2018 (SN: 6/6/18). Stalled-out cyclones mean more extreme rainfall — and significantly increased hazard for coastal
populations lying in the storms’ paths. That was true for both Harvey and
Florence, Kossin and climate scientist Timothy Hall of NASA Goddard Institute
for Space Studies in New York City reported in June in Climate and Atmospheric Science. So far, in some parts of the
Bahamas, Dorian’s rainfall exceeded 61 centimeters (two feet), according to
NASA’s satellite-based estimates released September 3. Hall talked to Science News about Dorian’s stall and
what scientists can and can’t say about linking slowed storms to climate change.
The interview is edited for brevity and clarity. SN: What does it mean for a storm to
stall?  Hall: In the case of Dorian, it basically came to a complete standstill. It’s only now just edging northwestward from that.  Hurricanes are like corks
floating on a stream — their paths are determined by the large-scale wind
fields in which they sit. When those wind fields collapse temporarily, like
they did for Dorian and did for Harvey in 2017, the hurricane doesn’t have any
guidance. It just stalls until a new set of wind fields is in place. The National Hurricane
Center posts storm characteristics every six hours. [In our paper], we defined meandering
as an abrupt change in direction from one six-hour time step to the next. If
the center of the storm spends at least 48 hours within a 200-kilometer radius,
we called it a stall. We just did an unofficial analysis of Dorian and it was
clearly a stall by that definition.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox SN: Is there a link between stalling and climate
change? Hall: [As far as what] we know about climate change and hurricanes, some things are virtually certain. Rising sea levels are leading to more coastal flooding, for sure. And increased rainfall is a pretty robust projection from changing climate. There’s a strong consensus now in the community that the intensity of tropical cyclones is getting stronger.  Then we get to the things
that are less well-known, but are still important to consider for hazards. One
is how climate change might be affecting the path that hurricanes take, which
would include the propensity to stall. One of the obvious suspects is that in a
warmer climate, the large-scale wind patterns in the atmosphere may slow down.
It’s very hard to tease out that signal from direct observations. It’s really
at the edge of what we understand right now. SN: You also found that stalling
hurricanes mean more heavy rains. Hall: Yes. One of the things you can say for Harvey, for example, is that aside from the stalling that Harvey did, there was so much rainfall that was driven by waters in the Gulf of Mexico that were extremely warm. Something like between 10 and 25 percent of the rain that fell on Houston could be attributed to human-induced warming (SN: 12/14/17). And for Dorian, the waters were very warm in the region where it stalled as well, a couple of degrees above the climatological mean for this time of year.  Future [climate change] attribution studies might encompass that (SN: 12/11/18).  SN: What’s the takeaway for now? Hall:  I’m glad that people are talking about stalling as an additional feature in the hazards of tropical cyclones. It just highlights how, yes, category is important, but it’s not the be-all, end-all of a storm’s hazard. There’s the physical size of the storm, how it moves, the angle at which it impacts the coastline — all of which are going to have an effect on storm surge and flooding. "
"13","Is climate change causing Europe’s intense heat? A scientist weighs in","Science News talks with climate scientist Karsten Haustein about attributing extreme heat events in Europe and South Asia to climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-heat-wave","Mainland Europe has sweltered for days under record-breaking temperatures, prompting researchers to try to untangle how much of the heat wave can be linked to climate change. A report on that, by an international consortium of scientists called the World Weather Attribution Network, is expected to be released on July 2. Previous heat records for many parts of Europe were set in the summer of 2003, when temperatures soared to 44.1° Celsius (111.4° Fahrenheit) in the southern French town of Conqueyrac. That extreme heat killed more than 70,000 people across the continent — a death toll  that researchers determined was amplified by climate change (SN: 9/3/16, p. 5). Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox As another heat wave in 2018 baked Europe for three months, the consortium conducted a rapid assessment that determined it could not have happened without anthropogenic, or human-caused, climate change. Such events could occur yearly if global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the researchers found. If global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, though, such events were predicted every two out of three years. This year’s event, which began in mid-June, is expected to be shorter. But it is intense. On June 28, temperatures in Gallargues-le-Montueux, a city in southern France, hit 45.9° C (114.6° F), smashing temperature records for the country. But Europe isn’t the only part of the world dealing with dangerous heat levels. India and Pakistan have been suffering since mid-May under one of the longest-lasting heat waves in its recent history. In June, temperatures in New Delhi soared to 48° C (118.4° F), the highest ever recorded for the month in the Indian capital. By June 21, at least 180 people reportedly had died from heat-related causes. Science News spoke with Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford in England who is affiliated with the consortium, about what’s behind these deadly events and how scientists determine in real time whether a particular heat wave can be attributed to climate change. His comments have been edited for clarity and brevity. SN: Why was the World Weather Attribution Network created? Haustein: The idea was that we would look at any given extreme events while they’re happening and try to scientifically attribute the climate change factor. For example, has it become a more likely event or not [due to climate change]? We define the event, put it into historic context — for example, is it a 1-in-100-year event? — and determine if it’s setting records or getting media attention. And then we do the model analyses to isolate the climate signal. We’re also teaching other researchers, in places including Kenya, South Africa and Australia, how to use our methods. SN: Why are you analyzing the current Europe heat wave? Haustein: This current heat wave just started 10 days ago. [By June 24], it was already shaping up to be pretty extreme, so we went for it. The all-time maximum temperature in France was 44.1° C, from August 2003. That was a really bad one. There are chances we’ll get up to 45° C, which would be quite a new record. [A few hours after this interview, that milestone was reached on June 28.] For June, that’s pretty epic. Germany’s temperatures will peak on Sunday [June 30], and probably Monday [July 1] in Austria. And then there are two cold fronts that will be pushing through. SN: What atmospheric conditions are causing the intense heat? Haustein: To get a heat wave going, you need warm air in the upper level [of the atmosphere]. That comes from the south, from Africa. We actually set a record [on June 27] for temperatures at 1.5 kilometers above Earth’s surface, reaching 25.5° C. How those upper-level air masses translate into temperatures on the surface is a different story. In simple terms, the jet stream where it sits across Europe divides colder air in the north from warmer air in the south. Sometimes [this fast current of air above the Northern Hemisphere] becomes very wiggly, with big loops going far to the north and all the way down to northern Africa. That can transport really hot air from Africa to Europe. If it sits over Europe for several days, it can heat the surface. What’s causing that wiggly jet stream is contentious. Some people have suggested it’s linked to increasing temperatures in the Arctic. But we don’t really know. All we can say is that, over the last 10 days, there’s been a tendency to have this pattern: We see the jet stream digging farther south, and Europe is sitting in this warm air. Extreme temperatures scorched much of India and Pakistan from mid-May through June 2019. NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System, a global atmospheric climate simulation, created this map of air temperatures across the region on June 10. Several factors contributed to the heat wave, including a delayed monsoon. The health impacts of South Asia’s rising temperatures are unclear, though, due to other factors that can impact health, including higher humidity and air pollution levels in the region. And it’s also not yet clear if the region has been seeing an overall trend of increasing maximum air temperatures since the 1970s. NASA Earth Observatory SN: What about the heat wave in South Asia?  Haustein: As far as climate attribution, it’s similar to work we did on the 2016 heat wave in India. [That heat wave included a record-breaking temperature of 51° C in the western state of Rajasthan.] India’s 2019 temperatures appear to be due to natural year-to-year variability. We did a brief analysis that found that maximum temperatures across India in the hottest months aren’t clearly increasing. SN: What did the consortium learn in analyzing the 2018 European heat wave? Haustein: We know that the frequency and intensity of heat waves are increasing globally. Heat waves in Europe, such as the one in 2018, are at least twice as likely to occur now as a result of climate change."
"14","Why this warmer world is not just a passing phase","Editor in Chief Nancy Shute discusses climate change and the uncertainty of science.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-warmer-world-not-just-passing-phase","In the late 1990s, three scientists published a paper charting the Earth’s temperatures over the last millennium. For the first 900 years, the trend line was the definition of boring: just little blips up and down. That changed around 1900, when the mean global temperature shot up, and kept rising. That now-famous trend line, dubbed “the hockey stick” because of its sharp upward slope, is so vivid that it has played a key role in two decades of argument over whether the Earth’s atmosphere is warming, and whether those changes are caused by heat-trapping gases generated by human activities.  It’s not hard to pick apart a single study’s data. Critics of the hockey stick pointed to centuries-long temperature shifts such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age to argue that anomalies in the 20th century were also short-term, natural shifts. Critics also noted the patchwork nature of the pre-1900 data, which didn’t rely on direct measurements, and said there was no direct evidence that increased greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels was causing the current temperature rise. Uncertainty is central to the enterprise of science. It’s a rare day when a single study — or dozens, or hundreds — answers a question without a doubt. And because uncertainty almost always remains, scientists have to explain both quantitatively and qualitatively how uncertain they are. That’s good science. But climate change naysayers used that uncertainty to say, “The scientists aren’t sure.” And it meant that when we journalists reported accurately on the science by noting uncertainty, we gave more ammunition to doubters. Well, scientists are now sure. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international consortium convened by the United Nations to evaluate the science of climate, released a report saying there was greater than 95 percent certainty that the substantial warming was due to human activities. And scientists are increasingly linking extreme weather events worldwide, from heat waves to hurricanes, to human-caused climate change (SN: 1/19/19, p. 7). In this issue, we report on how the city of Boston is regularly flooding due to rising sea levels. Freelancer Mary Caperton Morton explains how policy makers and scientists are racing to develop responses to keep the venerable city functioning as the water moves inland. And earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling reports on a startling new study that lays to rest the argument that the warming we’re experiencing is just another normal climate shift. This one is clearly different, the data show: Those earlier temperature fluctuations were regional; what’s happening now is worldwide.  Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State who is one of the researchers who developed the hockey stick data chart, said back in 2005 that he thought that people wouldn’t take climate change seriously until they saw it in their own backyards. People in Boston think they’re seeing it, as do people in many other communities around the world who are bracing for more extreme heat, rainfall, drought and storms. Our charge at Science News is to continue to report on the science while chronicling humankind’s responses, for good or ill. "

That’s probably because mammals have body temperatures too warm for most fungi to replicate as well as powerful immune systems. But climate change may be challenging those defenses, bringing new fungal threats to human health, a microbiologist warns. From 2012 to 2015, pathogenic versions of the fungus Candida auris arose independently in Africa, Asia and South America. The versions are from the same species, yet they are genetically distinct, so the spread across continents couldn’t have been caused by infected travelers, says Arturo Casadevall of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Instead, each continents’ C. auris may have become tolerant of the average normal body temperature of humans — about 37° Celsius — because the fungi acclimated to warming in the environment caused by climate change, Casadevall and colleagues argue. If this hypothesis turns out to be true, C. auris “may be the first example of a new fungal disease emerging from climate change” that poses a risk to humans, the researchers report online July 23 in mBio.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox New York, New Jersey and Illinois currently have the highest number of confirmed cases of C. auris in the country.  Confirmed cases of Candida auris in the United States as of May 31 Since mid-2016, when reporting of C. auris infections began in the United States, there have been nearly 700 cases confirmed in 12 states, with deadly outbreaks occurring among patients in hospitals and other health care facilities. More than 30 countries around the world have also reported cases. The fungus causes dangerous infections of the blood, brain, heart and other parts of the body. Studies show that an invasive infection can be fatal 30 to 60 percent of the time. And some infections are resistant to all available antifungal medications. Hospitalized patients tend to have weakened immune systems. But C. auris wouldn’t have been a health concern without first developing the ability to replicate inside people, Casadevall says, and it had to become more tolerant of warmer temperatures to do that. Past work has shown a fungus can be coaxed to grow at warmer temperatures in a laboratory setting. “There are millions of fungal species out there,” Casadevall says. “As they adapt to a warmer climate, some of them will then have the capacity to breach our thermal defenses.” Meanwhile, other fungi are wreaking destruction on many animals and plants, including frogs (SN: 4/27/19, p. 5), snakes (SN: 1/20/18, p. 16) and trees (SN: 5/3/03, p. 282). “A lot of our fellow creatures are being wiped out,” Casadevall says. And while mammals have tended to be “remarkably resistant to invasive fungal diseases,” he says, bats have been hit hard by outbreaks of a fungus that causes white nose syndrome in part because their body temperature drops during hibernation (SN Online: 7/15/19). “The fungal kingdom is just so vast,” Casadevall says. If another fungus dangerous to humans can evolve to “defeat our thermal barrier, who knows what it will do to us?”"
"16","How climate change is already altering oceans and ice, and what’s to come","A new IPCC report gives the lowdown on how climate change is already wreaking havoc on Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, and how much worse things could get.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future","Polar caps quickly
losing ice. Chalky coral reefs. Stronger storms that devastate islands and
cities, claiming lives and destroying homes. Those aren’t
speculations about what our world faces in a warmer future. Those are climate
change impacts happening now — and set to worsen, according to a new report by
the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The report, a summary of which was released on September 25, is the panel’s first comprehensive update on how human-driven climate change is upsetting Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, or cryosphere. Just how severe things get will depend on whether countries rein in climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, or continue pumping them into the atmosphere.  The report focuses
on forecasts for two potential scenarios: One involves curbing carbon emissions
to limit global warming to around 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
(The world is already more than halfway there, having warmed by 1.1 degrees C since 1900, according to a report by the World
Meteorological Organization published September 22.) In another, high-emissions
scenario, pollution continues apace, potentially warming the world by about 4
degrees C.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Science News took a look at the report’s predictions for how changes to
Earth’s oceans and ice will impact societies and our natural world, along with
the latest science on where things stand today.  Already, glaciers and ice sheets are
shrinking, and some are shrinking fast. The Greenland ice sheet lost an average
278 billion tons of ice per year from 2006 to 2015. That amount of water alone is
enough to cause average global sea levels to rise about 0.77 millimeters per
year. And on July 31, a record-breaking 57 percent of the sheet showed signs of melting (SN: 8/2/19). Meanwhile, the Antarctic ice
sheet lost an average 155 billion tons per year, or roughly enough to raise
seas by an average 0.43 millimeters per year (SN: 6/13/18).  Glaciers from the Himalayas to Chile and Canada on average have lost 220 billion
tons per year (SN: 4/6/15),
threatening the safety and livelihoods of millions of people who rely on melt water to meet
their water needs (SN:
6/19/19). Greenland and Antarctica have dominated ice
melt contributing to rising sea levels. Even with global action against climate
change, the two massive ice sheets are still expected to contribute a combined
11 centimeters or so of sea level rise by 2100. But without that effort, average
sea levels could rise up to some 27 centimeters by 2100 just from the melting
in Greenland and Antarctica, the IPCC report says.  Glaciers could add nine to 20 centimeters to
that rise, depending on emissions. And regions with mostly smaller glaciers, like
Central Europe, Scandinavia and the Andes, could lose more than 80 percent of
their current ice mass by the end of the century if emissions continue business-as-usual. Glacier
runoff, regardless of emissions scenarios, would peak by the end of the century
and then decline, potentially leaving less water available for future generations.
 Aside from the ice that sits atop mountains
and landmasses, thick ice blankets the Arctic Sea, with more expansive coverage
in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter. Scientists say the white ice plays an
important role in reflecting sunlight away from Earth, which keeps the Arctic
from getting too hot. But that ice is
shrinking. Although the sea ice
expands and contracts over the course of a year, the overall amount of ice has
steadily declined since 1979, the IPCC
says.  So much melting has left little ice that has
endured for at least five years (such hardened ice is expected to be sturdier
than single-season ice). In fact, as of last year, the fraction of sea ice
older than five years had declined by about 90 percent since 1979, the report
says. In Antarctica, meanwhile, there’s still a lot
of uncertainty about the state of sea ice now and in the future (SN: 6/27/17).  The lid of sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean (which expands in the winter and contracts in the summer) has been steadily shrinking, satellite records show. The 2019 minimum extent, reached September 18, is tied with two other years for the second lowest amount of ice cover: 4.15 million square kilometers. In a low-emissions scenario that limits global
warming to 1.5 degrees C, the probability of September being ice free after the
summertime melt is a mere 1 percent. But at 2 degree C warming, that risk jumps
to 10 to 35 percent. The loss of sea ice takes away habitat for Arctic mammals
and birds. And less ice also means more exposed water, which is dark and
absorbs more sunshine.  Permanently frozen soil, which has carbon trapped
in the ground, is warming to record levels, increasing an average of 0.29
degrees Celsius from 2007 to 2016, the IPCC says. Arctic and other northern permafrost
is estimated to contain almost twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere. A
thaw in permafrost could release trapped carbon dioxide and methane into the air
— though it’s not yet certain if that’s
happening today (SN: 12/19/16).  But thaw it will, the report says. By 2100,
the expanse of Earth’s permafrost could decrease by around 24 percent in a
low-emissions scenario, or 69 percent in a high-emissions future. Under that
scenario, permafrost could exhale tens to hundreds of billions of tons of
carbon, in the form of CO2 and methane, into the atmosphere by 2100,
possibly making global warming even worse. Thawed regions might see more plant
growth, pulling some of that carbon back into the soil — but not nearly enough
to make up for carbon releases. So far, oceans have swallowed up
more than 90 percent of the climate’s excess heat, and as a result have been
warming up. Marine heat waves, which scorch coral reefs (SN: 1/4/18) and help boost the frequency of toxic algal blooms (SN: 8/28/18), are getting more severe and lasting longer
than they did decades ago (SN: 4/10/18).
And human-caused climate change may have been responsible for nearly 90 percent
of these events between 2006 and 2015, the IPCC says.  Those hot waters — which will get even hotter
under any emissions scenario — are also helping to drive many ocean-dwelling
animals to move toward cooler digs near the poles (SN: 5/2/18). But in
new environments, migrant animals can interfere with local food webs (SN: 2/2/15). Climate-driven shifts in ocean species may have already hurt overall catch potential for
the world’s fisheries (SN: 2/28/19). By 2100, ocean surfaces are expected to absorb
five to seven times more heat than they have since 1970 under a high-emissions
scenario. And heat waves would be 50 times more frequent than they were in 1900.
In a low-emissions scenario, heat waves would be 20 times more frequent by 2100
than in 1900.   It’s not just heat that oceans take in. The
world’s biggest water bodies also have absorbed an estimated 20 to 30 percent
of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere since the 1980s, causing
seawater to become more acidic (SN: 4/28/17). That’s going to continue, the IPCC says. In a high-emissions scenario, the pH of the ocean surface is expected to drop by around 0.3 pH points (on a scale of 14) by the end of the century. That acidity may make it more difficult for creatures like snails, crabs and shrimps to build their shells and impairs the function of tiny algae that ferry carbon to the deep ocean. Acidity can also deplete seawater of the minerals that corals use to build their exoskeletons (SN: 2/23/16).  Sea levels are rising faster with time. And that swell is going to continue under any emissions scenario, the IPCC says. From 2006 to 2015, sea level rose about  3.6 millimeters per year, about 2.5 times as fast as sea level rise from 1901 to 1990. Melting ice sheets and glaciers are primarily to blame. With higher sea levels come greater flooding and coastal
erosion. Encroaching seawater can also shrink habitats and force species along
coastlines to relocate — if they can. (SN:
8/6/19). Nearly half of coastal wetlands already have
disappeared over the last century, due partly to higher seawater.  In a low-emissions future, sea level rise
could reach an average 4 millimeters per year in 2100, compared with 15
millimeters per year in a high-emissions future. Higher sea levels are also
affecting the risk of certain disasters, such as coastal flooding. Extreme
events related to high seas that were once rare — happening once a century — could
happen at least once per year in many places by 2050, especially in the
tropics. That puts coastal areas and small islands
in even greater danger (SN: 8/15/18).  Human-driven climate change has likely increased
the amount of wind and rain associated with some tropical cyclones already (SN: 9/13/18).
These storms will probably get more intense, with bigger storm surges and more
rainfall, even if emissions are limited. Scientists aren’t yet sure whether
tropical cyclones will become more frequent, though.  What could become more frequent, and possibly less predicable (SN: 8/21/19), are extreme El Niño and La Niña events (SN: 1/26/15). Extreme El Niños may hit twice as often in this century compared with the last, the report says. These weather disturbances are also expected to become more hazardous, causing dryer droughts and more torrential downpours around the world. "
"17","50 years ago, scientists puzzled over a slight global cooling","Five decades ago, scientists were puzzled over a slight dip in global temperatures. Today we know it was just a blip, and that Earth’s climate is warming thanks to industrial activity over the last century.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-puzzled-over-slight-global-cooling","Earth’s cooling climate, Science News, November 15, 1969 — The average temperature for the entire Earth rose gradually from the 1880s until the early 1940s. At that time, a cooling trend suddenly set in which is continuing today.… The amount of dust and other particulate matter in the atmosphere has increased dramatically in recent decades, a change that could counteract the thermal effect of carbon dioxide buildup. From 1940 to about 1975, the average global surface temperature decreased by about 0.1 degrees Celsius, interrupting a decades-long warming trend even as carbon emissions continued to rise. Many scientists thought the cooling trend was possibly caused by sulfate particles from the burning of fossil fuels that can scatter sunlight and reduce atmospheric warming (SN: 11/21/09, p. 5). That hunch proved correct: When the United States and other countries began to lower sulfur emissions in the 1970s to reduce acid rain and respiratory illnesses, the cooling ended abruptly. Since 1975, the average global temperature has risen by about 0.6 degrees C. Today, the average surface temperature is 1.1 degrees C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times (SN: 9/25/19). However, ongoing sulfate emissions, particularly from China and India, may still be slowing greenhouse gas-driven warming. Removing all aerosol emissions from the world at once could add about 0.7 degrees C to global temperatures. "
"18","Climate change may be throwing coral sex out of sync","Several widespread corals in the Red Sea are flubbing cues to spawn en masse.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-throwing-coral-sex-out-sync","Bad timing for coral sex might be an underappreciated threat of climate change.  Spawning is out of sync for at least three widespread coral species in the Red Sea, says Tom Shlesinger, a marine biologist at Tel Aviv University. And warmer seawater temperatures could be playing a role.   Records from the 1980s suggest that whole swaths of corals from particular species typically let colorful egg-sperm bundles float out of their tiny mouths and up into the water on the same few nights a year, Shlesinger says. Released in a big synchronized cloud, the sex cells separate from one another, gaining a chance at fertilization during the brief time that they survive on their own in seawater. It’s “a wonder of nature,” he says. But after four years of recent monitoring, Shlesinger argues that three of the five species studied no longer tightly synchronize their species-wide gamete releases. And few if any new colonies of these kinds of corals are showing up in recent surveys, so the species might dwindle away in the region, Shlesinger and Yossi Loya, also at Tel Aviv University, warn in the Sept. 6 Science.  Shlesinger didn’t set out to compare local spawning synchrony. But “it’s something that kind of grabbed me,” he says. After realizing some corals weren’t spawning when expected, “I started going to the sea at night.”  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox By the second year of his questing, he was snorkeling or diving several hours a night during spawning months. Some 150 species of corals mingle in the long, narrow gulf of the Red Sea that stretches northeast past Eilat in Israel and Aqaba in Jordan. Unlike the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, where more than 100 coral species can release their gametes together on the same night, the Red Sea’s corals spawn one species or a few at a time on their own special nights.  Shlesinger had seen corals spawn elsewhere, but the night he finally got the timing right to catch an event in the Red Sea was “magical,” he says. He first spotted small, red egg-sperm bundles drifting up from a single coral. Soon he was swimming through “a colorful snowstorm” of little red capsules rising from hundreds or even thousands of corals.  A whole species can synchronize its spawning to the same half-hour. That precision depends on an interlocking set of environmental cues. Water temperature, sunlight and wind affect the month of the event, researchers have found. The phase of the moon matters in determining the night, and local sunset cues the time.  Data from 1980 to 1982 on the five studied species show consistent, synchronous patterns of mass spawning, based on regular lab exams of coral samples plus nighttime swims. But during 225 swim surveys from 2015 through 2018, Shlesinger discovered that only two of the five species still managed to spawn en masse during just a few nights. Three others didn’t synchronize tightly. In 2018, for instance, at least a few big lumps of the brain coral Platygyra lamellina spawned just about every night from June 12 to July 18. Mini releases don’t create a thick enough soup of gametes to make fertilization likely or for there to be a lot left over after fish finish feasting on the bundles.  The moon still waxes and wanes regularly, but other spawning cues may be wavering out of sync with it. For instance, since 1982, when the earlier surveys were conducted, water in the northern part of the gulf has warmed about 0.31 degrees Celsius per decade, the researchers calculate. (Pollutants, especially hormone-disrupting ones, might also be sabotaging coral reproduction, the scientists say.) Corals around the world are already threatened by rising temperatures, which can cause corals to severely bleach and die (SN: 1/4/18), among other threats. Various efforts are under way to help rehab and protect these spectacular ecosystems (SN: 10/18/16).  Biologists have certainly fretted that climate change might also knock coral spawning synchrony askew, says James Guest, a coral biologist at Newcastle University in England. It’s not easy finding old records with methods comparable with today’s, however. For instance, older data might have missed some of the smaller blips in synchrony that showed up in Shlesinger’s diligent swimming, Guest says.   And some corals have a bit of natural play in their timing, says Taryn Foster, a coral biologist at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. In her work off the coast of Australia, she’s found that corals in Scott Reef observe a sort of leap year. Every two or three seasons, they split their spawning into two separate bursts, thus coping with the way moon phases cycle faster than annual cues. These corals, however, break their spawning into roughly equal parts. It’s the small bursts of spawning described in the new study that she worries about. That’s the menace to the three corals, Shlesinger says. In five sample plots in each of two areas at Eilat that he monitored, some other species were doing well, but he struggled to find youngsters for the three out-of-sync coral species. For two of them, he often found no new youngsters at all. "

available to us today may very well be gone tomorrow if we don’t slow the
development of antibiotic resistance,” said Robert Redfield, director of the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, during a news
briefing on November 13.  In its first report on drug-resistant infections in six years, the CDC revised its 2013 report using newly available data including electronic health records from over 700 hospitals. The number of annual deaths from drug-resistant infections at that time is now estimated to have been around 44,000 — almost double the 23,000 deaths previously estimated.  The new report also estimates that currently about 35,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections, reflecting an 18 percent decrease from the revised number of the 2013 report. That shows there’s been progress in reducing the spread of drug-resistant microbes typically associated with hospitals, a major source of deaths, said Michael Craig, a senior advisor on antimicrobial resistance at the CDC, during the news briefing.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Even with the additional
data, however, the CDC considers its estimates conservative. In a letter
published in Infection Control &
Hospital Epidemiology in 2019, researchers from Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis, using different methodologies, estimate that more than 150,000 people in the United States died from drug-resistant microbes in 2010. “The CDC’s new numbers represent excellent progress in
assessing the burden of antibiotic resistance, but they still likely
underestimate its vast impact,” says Greg Frank, director of infectious disease
policy for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry group in
Washington, D.C. Deaths due to drug-resistant microbes are often underreported
because many patients with these infections also have other health issues that
could get recorded as the cause of death, he says. The latest report also adds two new drug-resistant organisms to the CDC’s list of bacteria and fungi that the agency considers urgent public health threats. The fungus Candida auris and bacteria Acinetobacter that are resistant to the antibiotic carbapenem join the bacteria Clostridioides difficile, drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to carbapenem on the list.  N. gonorrhoeae causes
the common, sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea and can cause infertility in women (SN:
12/9/02). Acinetobacter spreads mainly in health care facilities, causing
pneumonia and urinary tract infections.  C. auris, which
causes severe and often fatal infections in hospitalized patients, is “a pathogen that we didn’t even
know about when we put out the last report in 2013,” Craig said. “Since then,
it has circumnavigated the globe and has caused a lot of infections and
deaths.” Its quick rise from a medically unknown fungus to worldwide health threat
may be due to climate change, according to one theory (SN: 7/26/19). "
"20","Climate change may make El Niño and La Niña less predictable","Atlantic Niñas and Niños have been fairly reliable bellwethers for severe El Niño and La Niña events in the Pacific. A warming world may change that.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-may-make-el-nino-la-nina-less-predictable","Climate change may
make it harder
to predict the most severe of the El Niño and La Niña weather disturbances
in the Pacific Ocean. That’s because these events will become less connected
with what happens halfway around the world in the Atlantic, researchers report
online August 21 in Science Advances.
 In today’s climate, cooling in the waters of the equatorial Atlantic, called an Atlantic Niña, can lead to especially warm water in the equatorial Pacific, or El Niño (SN: 5/28/16, p. 13). Meanwhile, warmer Atlantic Niño waters tend to give rise to the cooler waters of La Niña in the Pacific. That call-and-response relationship, which involves air being swept into the atmosphere from over the Atlantic and settling down over the Pacific, can give forecasters an edge in anticipating destructive El Niño and La Niña events.  But as the atmosphere
gets warmer, that gas exchange is expected to become more sluggish, weakening the
Atlantic’s sway over the Pacific. Future El Niños and La Niñas may not follow
the Atlantic events as reliably as in the past, new simulations suggest. That could
make it harder to prepare for especially disruptive El Niño
and La Niña episodes, which can incite flooding in some regions while drying
up others or making hurricanes stronger (SN
Online: 11/10/16). Researchers gauged
just how reliably Atlantic Niñas and Niños have been bellwethers for El Niños
and La Niñas in the past by comparing the patterns of these events over the last
several decades. The team found that the strongest El Niños and La Niñas —
including the 1998 La Niña that caused floods in China and hurricanes in the
Caribbean, killing tens of thousands of people — were almost always preceded by
Atlantic events. Computer simulations revealed
how the Atlantic-Pacific relationship might change if climate-warming carbon emissions
continue to rise throughout the 21st century. The simulations suggest that,
while future extreme El Niño and La Niña events are expected
to happen more frequently, only about half of these events will be
foreshadowed by Atlantic events (SN Online: 1/26/15).  So “it’s going to be
harder to predict the Pacific extreme El Niño and extreme La Niña,” says study
coauthor Wenju Cai, a climate scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization in Aspendale, Australia. These findings, while plausible, “must be interpreted with some caution” because computer simulations don’t perfectly emulate ocean-atmosphere interactions, says climate scientist Maria Belen Rodriguez-Fonseca of the Complutense University of Madrid. If future Atlantic Niños and Niñas aren’t as useful for predicting Pacific activity, “it’s not going to be catastrophic,” she says. The Atlantic Ocean is but one element among many environmental factors, such as conditions in the Pacific and Indian oceans, that feed into forecasts for these meteorological juggernauts.  "
"21","Nepal is reeling from an unprecedented dengue outbreak","As climate change opens new regions to mosquitoes, Nepal suffers an outbreak of the painful viral disease that has sickened more than 9,000 people.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nepal-reeling-from-unprecedented-dengue-virus-outbreak","KATHMANDU, Nepal — When mosquito season brought past dengue outbreaks to regions across the Asian tropics, Nepal hardly had to worry. The high-altitude Himalayan country was typically too chilly for the disease-carrying insects to live. But with climate change opening new paths for the viral disease, Nepal is now reeling from an unprecedented outbreak.  At least 9,000 people — from 65 of Nepal’s 77
districts — have been diagnosed with dengue since August, including six
patients who have died, according to government health data.  “We have never had an outbreak like this
before,” says Dr. Basu Dev Pandey, director of the Sukraraj Tropical and
Infectious Diseases Hospital in the nation’s capital, Kathmandu. With dozens of
people lined up for blood testing on September 26 at the nearby fever clinic,
set up this year to handle the outbreak, Pandey continues: “People are afraid.”
 Dengue is carried by the Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes,
and has long been associated with warmer, low-lying tropical climates where the
insects thrive. But for years, researchers have warned that dengue and other
mosquito-borne illnesses would spread into new regions, as climate change
brings warmer temperatures and alters rainfall patterns so that cooler regions
become more hospitable for mosquitoes (SN:
9/15/11).  Nepal is proving to be a real-world example of
this change. The country had its first-ever
dengue outbreak in 2006, but only a handful of people were affected that year
from lowland districts along the southern border with India.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox “Climate
change has created the conditions for the transmission of dengue at higher
elevations,” says Meghnath Dhimal,
chief research officer at the Nepal Health Research Council, a government
agency based in Kathmandu. Atmospheric temperatures in the Himalayan Mountains
have been increasing by an average of 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. So across
Nepal, there are increasingly more days each year that fall into the ideal
temperature range for A. aegypti of
20° to 30° Celsius, Dhimal says. Areas like the capital are having fewer summer nights and days
below 15° C, around where mosquitoes tend to stop feeding. Nepal also saw its
heaviest monsoon rainfall in a decade in July, with severe flooding reported
across the country. Floods typically lead to the pooling of stagnant water,
prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In recent years, the country started spraying insecticide to control mosquito populations in Kathmandu,
which sits in a mountain valley about 1,400 meters above sea level.  The disease, which had caused severe outbreaks
in only nine countries before 1970, is now endemic in more than 100 countries, according to
the World Health Organization. An estimated 390 million people
worldwide get dengue infections every year, with about a quarter developing
symptoms, researchers said in a 2013 paper in Nature. Some of that spread is
explained by urbanization as well as global travel and trade. But studies show
that atmospheric temperatures are the most important drivers for dengue distribution and risk, followed by rainfall patterns, according to a
2016 review paper in Environmental
Research.   With climate change,
“warmer temperatures can affect both the mosquito and the virus,” says coauthor
Kristie Ebi, a public health expert at the University of Washington in Seattle.
A hotter climate helps mosquito larvae develop faster into adulthood, while
also increasing the rate at which the dengue virus replicates within the
mosquito, she says.  “There seems to be
dengue outbreaks worldwide this year,” Ebi says. In August, for example, the
Philippines declared a national emergency after dengue killed some 300 people
and was suspected of sickening another 77,000 in the first 20 weeks of 2019 —
almost double the number of cases reported during the same period the previous
year in the Southeast Asian island nation.  And worldwide, it’s only
going to get worse, according to a study published June 10 in Nature Microbiology. In that work,
researchers built a map of global dengue distribution in 2015, and then
predicted how climate change as well as socioeconomic and population trends
would make new areas suitable for dengue transmission. By 2050, those areas would include cities in coastal
China and Japan, southern Africa and the southeastern United States,
epidemiologist Janey Messina at the University of Oxford and her colleagues
find.  Similar trends also are
expected — if not already seen — for other insect-driven viral diseases,
including West Nile virus (SN: 11/28/18), chikungunya (SN: 6/2/15) and tick-borne Lyme disease
(SN: 8/9/17).  Scientists have been working to develop a vaccine against dengue
(SN: 6/15/16), but there is still no
proven cure. Doctors can only ease symptoms that include
headache, high fever, severe muscle pain, nausea and skin rash. Without
treatment for symptoms, the disease can be deadly, killing roughly 20,000 people a year, according
to WHO. Even with treatment, people are typically sick and unable to work for
several weeks if not months. "

Conspiracy theorists have hijacked some climate-related terms to spread misinformation on the online video-sharing website, a social scientist warns. He urges his colleagues to respond by getting accurate information about their work to science communicators on YouTube.  While Facebook and Twitter get the lion’s share of attention when it comes to concerns about fake news, Joachim Allgaier of RWTH Aachen University in Germany says YouTube is equally, if not more insidious, given its huge popularity. Allgaier, who focuses on how science is communicated online, initially researched science-themed music videos on the site. He found several on Darwin’s theory of evolution, one song about the periodic table by the band They Might Be Giants and a parody by an Alzheimer’s research team contorting the lyrics to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” to sing about being “caught in a bad project.” “I was amazed by the creativity,” Allgaier says. But he was also disturbed by music videos attacking established science. Those science skeptics questioned the fact that human activities are driving climate change, the use of chemotherapy to treat cancer and the safety of vaccines. So Allgaier decided to investigate what kind of YouTube videos he found when he searched the site using 10 different climate-related terms, including “climate change,” “global warming” and “climate science.” He also searched for “climate manipulation” and “geoengineering,” terms that refer to emerging large-scale technologies to cool the Earth and offset global warming, such as adding tiny, sunlight-blocking particles high in the stratosphere (SN: 11/28/15, p. 26). To prevent earlier searches from shaping the results of later searches, Allgaier obscured his IP address, location and search history. Then, he analyzed the top 20 videos for each of the 10 terms. Of those 200 videos, 89 support the established scientific premise that climate change is the result of human activities. But four feature neutral debates between scientists and climate change skeptics, and 16 deny that humans are causing climate change. Most strikingly, 91 videos promote conspiracy theories about climate change or climate engineering, particularly about so-called chemtrails, Allgaier reports July 25 in Frontiers in Communication. Chemtrailers believe politicians or government agents are spreading toxic chemicals through airplanes’ condensation trails — an idea unrelated to climate change, and not supported by science. Many people could view that misinformation, Allgaier warns. YouTube says that it reaches roughly 2 billion users each month, or about a third of all internet users — making it a powerful communication tool. A 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., questioned 4,581 adults in the United States from July 30 to August 12 and found that 21 percent of people get their news from YouTube. In Germany, over 70 percent of another survey’s respondents aged 14 to 29 reported using YouTube and other online video platforms to be informed about science. That survey, by Berlin-based science communications company Science in Dialogue, questioned 1,008 people from August 6 to August 13, 2018. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Allgaier also found that more common search terms like “climate change” and “global warming” typically lead to accurate videos. But newer terms like “geoengineering” and “climate modification” lead to those chemtrail videos almost 93 percent of the time. Some geoengineering ideas are perfect fodder for conspiracy theorists, especially ones that propose injecting particles into the atmosphere. Plus, geoengineering is a relatively new research area, and geoscientists have a minimal presence on YouTube, Allgaier says. That has enabled conspiracy theorists to hijack terms related to the technology through tactics like mirroring, where followers upload a video to multiple YouTube channels and tag each version with different keywords to dominate the online-video database. Other tactics include making it easier for people discover links to the conspiracy videos during searches through search engine optimization and commenting on legitimate science videos with links to conspiracy content.   Scientists and science communicators must flood YouTube with scientifically accurate content, and even mimic those conspiracy tactics, Allgaier argues, to reclaim scientific terms that have been highjacked. Otherwise, researchers risk ceding control of information about their work to the conspirators. “It’s necessary to take action,” he says."
"23","IPCC report warns of a bleak future for oceans and frozen regions under climate change","A new IPCC report offers dire warnings about how climate change is altering oceans, the polar regions and the high snowy mountains.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-report-climate-change-bleak-future-oceans-cryosphere-solutions","Earth’s oceans and frozen regions are changing alarmingly quickly, scientists warn in the first comprehensive look at how greenhouse gas emissions are altering the planet’s seas and cryosphere.  Since 1993, the rate of
warming in the oceans has more than doubled, scientists report in a new study
by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Melting of the
two great ice sheets blanketing Greenland and West Antarctica is speeding up as
well, accelerating sea level rise. And West Antarctica’s glaciers may already
be so unstable that they are past the point of no return. “The consequences for nature
and humanity are sweeping and severe,” Ko Barrett, IPCC vice-chair and head of
research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said at a news
conference September 24. Rising seas are already threatening low-lying coastal
areas that today are home to 680 million people, about 10 percent of the
world’s population.   The Sept. 25 release of a summary
of the report coincided with the U.N.
Climate Action Summit in New York City. And it came amidst a surge of global
protests, climate strikes and calls for nations around the world to
dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions in hopes of limiting future warming.
 Such action can’t come too soon, scientists say. Already, warming ocean waters are yielding fewer fish (SN: 2/28/19), and are fueling more intense, rainier tropical storms (SN: 9/28/18). Ocean heat waves are increasing, threatening corals and other sea life (SN: 4/10/18). Greenland (SN: 9/18/19) and the West Antarctic ice sheet (SN: 8/5/19) are rapidly shedding ice, accelerating sea level rise to a rate of 3.5 millimeters per year. And Arctic sea ice continues to dwindle (SN: 3/14/19); minimum sea-ice extent in 2019 tied with 2007 and 2016, according to data released by the National Snow and Ice Data Center on September 23. That’s the second-lowest extent on satellite record, after 2012. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox “The ocean has largely been
left out of the discussion on climate,” says Becca Gisclair, senior director of
Arctic Programs for the Ocean Conservancy in Bellingham, Wash., who was not
involved in the IPCC study. The new report emphasizes the need to “slash
emissions, and do it quickly, or these impacts highlighted in the report will
quickly become irreversible…. My hope is that seeing all of these impacts in
one place can highlight the need for action.” The extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean reached its minimum for the year — 4.15 million square kilometers — on September 18, tying for the second lowest minimum in the satellite record with 2007 and 2016. The lowest measured sea ice extent was in 2012. The report is one of several
special reports focusing on the latest science on specific aspects of climate
change that the IPCC releases in between its large, sweeping assessments. Since
the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report came out in 2013, scientists have learned a
great deal about the impacts of absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide on the
oceans and their denizens, as well as in coastal areas, says Sarah Cooley,
director of the Ocean Conservancy’s ocean acidification program in Washington,
D.C. For this new report, 104 scientists from 36 countries evaluated 6,981
studies to determine the impact on the world’s oceans and ice-covered regions.  While the IPCC report rings
an alarm bell, there is hope, says climate scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, who
heads the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia.
The ocean isn’t just part of the problem, Hoegh-Guldberg says — it should be a
key part of the solution. “What’s surprising is how quickly we can limit the
damage,” Hoegh-Guldberg says, a message that he says was also embedded within the
IPCC’s 2018 special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius of
warming, for which he was a
contributing author (SN: 12/17/18).  Hoegh-Guldberg and
colleagues recently assessed ways to harness ocean resources to reduce or
mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. The study, commissioned by a group of
15 world leaders called the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, was released September 23 by the World Resources
Institute. In it, the researchers highlight five ocean-related activities that they say can help slow warming: Those five activities have the potential to account for as much as 21 percent of the emissions reductions needed by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times by the end of the century, Hoegh-Guldberg and colleagues write in the Sept. 27 Science. That help is sorely needed. Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1.1 degrees C, and studies suggest that global emissions are now on track to blow past midcentury targets needed to achieve 1.5 degrees (SN: 7/1/19).   Taken together, the two new
studies provide “a nice point-counterpoint,” says Jane Lubchenco, a marine
biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Lubchenco, who ran NOAA from
2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, is a co-chair of the High Level
Panel’s expert group of researchers and policy analysts. The IPCC special
report “shines a very bright spotlight on the ocean as a victim,” Lubchenco
says. “But it is also a powerful source of solutions.”  None of these potential
solutions are new concepts, but there has been little political will to invest
in the necessary research and development to move them forward, Hoegh-Guldberg says.
These actions may finally get some traction in December, when nations head to
Santiago, Chile, for COP25, the annual meeting to review progress of the U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change.  At the COP21 meeting in Paris in December 2015, 195 nations signed on to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, pledging to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep global warming to “well below” 2 degrees C above preindustrial times (SN: 12/12/15). The United States was one of the signing nations, but President Donald Trump has said he plans to withdraw the country from the accord in 2020 (SN: 6/1/17). Chile President Sebastián
Piñera has said COP25 will be the “Blue COP,” emphasizing the central role that
he expects ocean economies to play in the discussions. The U.N. climate meeting
in December is also a prelude to a 2020 deadline for Paris Agreement
signatories to submit revised and increasingly ambitious plans to reduce their
emissions.  Ocean-based mitigation
solutions could become a big part of those plans, Gisclair says. “There is a
big opportunity there for countries to make new climate commitments that
include the ocean.”"
"24","Hurricane Dorian’s slow pace makes it dangerous and hard to predict","Hurricane Dorian is one of several recent hurricanes that moved extremely slowly. Whether that's due to climate change isn't yet clear.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricane-dorian-slow-pace-dangerous-predictions-hard","Hurricane Dorian has been a
slow, near-record-breaking, rough beast of a storm. After more than 24 hours of
hovering over the northern Bahamas and pummeling the islands with wind, rain
and surging seas, Dorian finally got moving again on September 3. It slouched
northward toward the U.S. coast as a category 2 hurricane, with sustained winds
of about 177 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour). The second-strongest
Atlantic hurricane on record (and strongest outside the tropics), Dorian made
landfall in the Bahamas on September 1 as a powerful category 5 storm, with
sustained winds of about 298 kilometers per hour (185 miles per hour). The
hurricane’s fury was dangerous enough, but then it practically stopped — shifting a mere 40 kilometers as it churned over the
Caribbean nation. That’s the second slowest trek for an Atlantic hurricane
after 1965’s Hurricane Betsy, a category 4 storm. That snail’s pace has stymied
forecasters trying to determine the storm’s path as it heads toward the United
States.  Dorian’s slog makes it one
of several strong but lethargic cyclones in recent decades, a trend that includes
2017’s Hurricane Harvey (SN: 9/28/18), 2018’s Hurricane Florence (SN: 9/13/18) and Cyclone
Idai, which struck Mozambique in March. In fact, over the last 70 years, cyclones
around the globe have been slowing down, James Kossin, a climate scientist with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is based in Madison, Wisc.,
found in 2018 (SN: 6/6/18). Stalled-out cyclones mean more extreme rainfall — and significantly increased hazard for coastal
populations lying in the storms’ paths. That was true for both Harvey and
Florence, Kossin and climate scientist Timothy Hall of NASA Goddard Institute
for Space Studies in New York City reported in June in Climate and Atmospheric Science. So far, in some parts of the
Bahamas, Dorian’s rainfall exceeded 61 centimeters (two feet), according to
NASA’s satellite-based estimates released September 3. Hall talked to Science News about Dorian’s stall and
what scientists can and can’t say about linking slowed storms to climate change.
The interview is edited for brevity and clarity. SN: What does it mean for a storm to
stall?  Hall: In the case of Dorian, it basically came to a complete standstill. It’s only now just edging northwestward from that.  Hurricanes are like corks
floating on a stream — their paths are determined by the large-scale wind
fields in which they sit. When those wind fields collapse temporarily, like
they did for Dorian and did for Harvey in 2017, the hurricane doesn’t have any
guidance. It just stalls until a new set of wind fields is in place. The National Hurricane
Center posts storm characteristics every six hours. [In our paper], we defined meandering
as an abrupt change in direction from one six-hour time step to the next. If
the center of the storm spends at least 48 hours within a 200-kilometer radius,
we called it a stall. We just did an unofficial analysis of Dorian and it was
clearly a stall by that definition.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox SN: Is there a link between stalling and climate
change? Hall: [As far as what] we know about climate change and hurricanes, some things are virtually certain. Rising sea levels are leading to more coastal flooding, for sure. And increased rainfall is a pretty robust projection from changing climate. There’s a strong consensus now in the community that the intensity of tropical cyclones is getting stronger.  Then we get to the things
that are less well-known, but are still important to consider for hazards. One
is how climate change might be affecting the path that hurricanes take, which
would include the propensity to stall. One of the obvious suspects is that in a
warmer climate, the large-scale wind patterns in the atmosphere may slow down.
It’s very hard to tease out that signal from direct observations. It’s really
at the edge of what we understand right now. SN: You also found that stalling
hurricanes mean more heavy rains. Hall: Yes. One of the things you can say for Harvey, for example, is that aside from the stalling that Harvey did, there was so much rainfall that was driven by waters in the Gulf of Mexico that were extremely warm. Something like between 10 and 25 percent of the rain that fell on Houston could be attributed to human-induced warming (SN: 12/14/17). And for Dorian, the waters were very warm in the region where it stalled as well, a couple of degrees above the climatological mean for this time of year.  Future [climate change] attribution studies might encompass that (SN: 12/11/18).  SN: What’s the takeaway for now? Hall:  I’m glad that people are talking about stalling as an additional feature in the hazards of tropical cyclones. It just highlights how, yes, category is important, but it’s not the be-all, end-all of a storm’s hazard. There’s the physical size of the storm, how it moves, the angle at which it impacts the coastline — all of which are going to have an effect on storm surge and flooding. "

population of humpback whales that swims the seas between South America and
Antarctica has bounced back.  An estimated 25,000 Megaptera
novaeangliae now live in the
western South Atlantic. That’s about 93 percent of the population’s prehunt
levels, which also were updated by a new counting method, researchers report
October 16 in Royal Society Open Science. “It is good news,” says María Vázquez, a biologist at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City who was not involved in
the assessment. She’s been studying a threatened population of humpbacks off
the west coast of Mexico and has observed its progress, too. “We see it year
after year, there are more animals, younger, more offspring,” she says. This rebound may be part of a global trend for
humpbacks. Of 14 known populations — seven in the Southern Hemisphere and seven
in the Northern Hemisphere — 10 have shown signs of recovery, according to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The other four are not
recovering and are considered endangered. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Whale hunting, which began in the western South Atlantic around 1830, caused the humpback population there to plummet to a low of 440 by 1958. With commercial whaling first curbed and then eventually banned in 1986, the population began to recover.  Assessments by the International Whaling Commission
between 2006 and 2015 suggested that the population had recovered to about 30
percent of its abundance prior to exploitation. But counting moving animals is
complicated, even more so when the animals are migrating thousands of
kilometers underwater and are seen only when they surface to breathe. For the study, researchers considered air- and
ship-based observations, as well as new historical and genetic data that
suggest the population was more resilient and productive than thought. “In the
previous assessment, we had a less accurate estimate of population size, and we
only had data on modern whaling,” says Alex Zerbini, a marine biologist at the NOAA’s Marine Mammal
Laboratory in Seattle.  For instance, historic data on struck-and-lost rates —
when hunters harpooned a whale, but it escaped and later died — allowed
researchers to reach more accurate estimates for a prehunt population of around
27,000 humpbacks. And genetic data let the team “estimate the minimum number of
reproductive females available to the population during the bottleneck,” when
the population’s numbers were at their lowest and genetic variability was
reduced, Zerbini says. “So when the population is very, very small, we have an
idea of how many female existed.”    The genetic data excites Vázquez. It demonstrates that
the population in the South Atlantic did not lose genetic variation, something
fundamental to consider the population healthy, she says. Zerbini says he hopes the new counting method will reveal similar success stories with the other humpback populations. But he worries that humpbacks may be recovering just to face new threats from climate change and marine debris (SN: 8/10/15). “Climate change affects the entire ecosystem, so it will affect whales,” he warns. And “it also will affect the whales’ prey and the whales’ competitors” (SN: 10/15/19)."

As a result, foodborne Campylobacter infections could increase with climate change, proposes epidemiologist Melanie Cousins of the University of Waterloo in Canada.  Cousins’ computer simulation, still a proof-of-concept version, focuses on how the warm weather surge in house flies and their activity affects the typical spring-summer rise in Campylobacter cases. Under a scenario of summers 2.5 degrees Celsius warmer on average than in 2003, the simulation predicts about 28 percent more Campylobacter cases in the Canadian province of Ontario by 2050, she and colleagues say February 13 in Royal Society Open Science. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Campylobacter infections are most often caused by contaminated food, perhaps by a fly that’s strolled on other tainted food, an infected animal or feces. Most people recover from an infection within about 10 days. The bacteria are the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness in Canada, with Ontario averaging more than 3,000 cases a year. The United States has some 1.3 million infections a year. To set up a simplified simulation, Cousins used data from 2005 on reported Campylobacter infections in Ontario to estimate transmission rates and fly birth and death rates. She then plugged those rates into the simulation to predict subsequent years’ Campylobacter infections. Those results came close to the real data available through 2013, and allowed her to predict future infections under different warming scenarios. The simulation assumes flies become more active with climate change since, like other insects, they depend on ambient temperatures for heating and cooling. It also assumes bacterial increases with warming. The study is just the latest to highlight consequences of warming on insect behavior. Other studies have predicted how climate change might increase pest attacks on crops (SN: 9/29/18, p. 8) and affect public health, such as Lyme disease’s creep into Canada (SN: 8/19/17, p. 16)."
"27","Extreme snowfall kept most plants and animals in one Arctic ecosystem from reproducing","A very snowy winter in 2018 left parts of Greenland covered well into the summer, causing an ecosystem-wide reproductive collapse in one area.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-snowfall-arctic-greenland-plants-animals-reproducing","When Jeroen Reneerkens stepped off the plane in
Greenland, all he saw was white. The avian ecologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands was expecting to find snowless tundra teeming with life, as he had each summer for nearly a decade. Reneerkens travels to Zackenberg Research Station in northeast Greenland to study sanderlings — slight, mottled-brown arctic shorebirds — as they and other migratory shorebirds noisily descend on the open tundra to breed each summer (SN: 11/13/18). But when Reneerkens arrived in 2018, he found
only snow and silence. “There were no birds singing, even the river was still
frozen,” Reneerkens says. “I was shocked.” A study published October 15 in PLOS Biology documents an ecosystem-wide reproductive collapse around Zackenberg in 2018. Most plants and animals, including everything from arctic foxes to tiny Dryas flowers, failed to reproduce that year, because an extremely snowy winter left much of the ground covered with snow well into summer, Reneerkens and colleagues found.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Climate scientists predict that, as the globe
warms, parts of the Arctic will
see more precipitation and more extreme seasonal fluctuations (SN: 9/25/19). If years
like 2018 become more common, the authors warn that the consequences for the
ecosystem could be drastic. “To see failure at so many levels of the food
web is highly unusual,” says Warwick Vincent, an arctic ecologist at Laval
University in Quebec City who wasn’t involved in the study. “Climate change is
all about extremes, and this is a compelling example of how we’re moving into a
world that’s less and less predictable.”  For more than two decades, researchers at Zackenberg have carefully tracked the rhythms of arctic life. “There’s no such thing as a normal arctic summer,” says study coauthor Niels Martin Schmidt, an ecologist at Aarhus University in Roskilde, Denmark. But the snow usually melts in early June. “It’s like the lid gets pulled off the ecosystem, and everything starts,” he says. Plants peek out of the soil and open their flowers to the long days. Hordes of insects emerge, pollinating plants and becoming food for migratory birds. Arctic fox cubs prowl bird nests looking for eggs, and stolid musk oxen birth calves that quickly join the herd. “It’s a highly interdependent ecosystem that is
resilient to variability,” says Martin Schmidt, “but only to a point.” The extreme snowfall in
2018, more than double what many parts of the field site usually experience,
proved too much for the ecosystem, the researchers found.  By late July 2018, when the tundra around the
research station is usually in full swing, 45 percent of the landscape was
still covered in snow, entombing many plants and insects. While many plants
eventually did flower, their seeds didn’t have enough time to sprout before the
first freeze in August, the team found. Insects eventually emerged, but mostly too
late to be fed upon by migratory birds. That meant that the sanderlings and other birds that had flown halfway around the globe from as far as Namibia expecting a feast arrived to slim pickings.  “Many birds must’ve turned back. We only
saw about a quarter of what we normally see,” Reneerkens says. The birds that
did arrive huddled close to the field station for food scraps. “They were
skeletons with some feathers,” he says, “Just super, super lean.” Reneerkens found just one sanderling nest that
season, which hatched “ridiculously late” on August 5, he says. Normally, the
eggs would hatch in mid-July. Other birds fared just as poorly, and the few young
that did hatch probably weren’t healthy enough to survive the southward
migration, starting in later August. Mammals were hit hard, too. The researchers saw
no arctic fox cubs, and almost no musk ox calves that season. The entire
ecosystem essentially came to a reproductive halt, Martin Schmidt says. “I try
not to be sentimental, but it was scary,” he says. “In nearly 25 years of
monitoring, we’ve never seen anything like this.” One bad year, even this bad, doesn’t spell disaster for an arctic ecosystem. Plants and animals can reproduce again the next year, with few consequences. But the following summer swung towards the opposite extreme: Record high temperatures led to a much earlier snowmelt and then drier conditions in Zackenberg.  The researchers worry that, as extreme events become more common, one bad breeding year could extend to two or three. “How many years in between do we need before the system collapses for real?” Martin Schmidt asks. “That we don’t know.” "
"28","Tidal floods driven by climate change may hurt small businesses","Parking data from Annapolis, Md.’s historic downtown shows how tidal flooding, driven by sea rise, can hurt local business.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tidal-floods-climate-change-hurt-small-businesses","WASHINGTON — Sea level rise, driven by climate change, is causing increased flooding during high tides along much of the U.S. coastline. Though such floods are usually minor, a new study suggests that car traffic patterns could help reveal how floods harm an area’s business revenues. Tidal flooding events “are not one in a hundred years or one in a thousand years. They’re once a week,” says Miyuki Hino, an environmental social scientist at Stanford University. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Though increasingly frequent, such floods often last only a few hours. That can make it hard to tally the economic losses they cause. Hino and her colleagues sought to quantify those impacts by looking at parking data in the historic downtown of Annapolis, Md., located on the Chesapeake Bay.  The team first built a database of flood events using flood images posted to social media at the same times that tide gauge readings showed high water levels, in order to eliminate rain-caused flooding. Hino’s team estimates there were 44 tidal floods in 2017, classified as minor, modest or severe. The team then looked at parking transactions in a nearby lot for changes in parking revenues. Flood events coincided with drops in visitation ranging from 37 to 89 percent, depending on the severity of the flooding, the researchers found. That contributed to about 3,000 fewer visitors, or a 1.7 percent decrease, in 2017, according to the study published online February 15 in Science Advances. While combined 2017 annual revenues for 16 area businesses totaled $12.2 million in 2017, the researchers did not have access to the shops’ daily financials. So they looked to city data tallying daily revenues at downtown businesses for dates that flooded (defined as moderate to severe on Hino’s scale) in 2016 but not 2015. They found that revenues on those days dropped by 22.5 percent on average. That let researchers estimate the economic losses caused by flooding’s impact on visitors in 2017. A 1.7 percent drop in annual visitors would have led to between a 0.7 percent and a 1.4 percent loss in revenues for the 16 downtown businesses — or between $86,000 to $172,000, Hino and her colleagues conclude. Because seas are expected to continue rising in coming decades (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7), such tidal flood losses are likely to increase, says Hino, who also presented the work at a Feb. 14 news conference at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The study is useful in drawing attention to costs and damages from tidal flooding, says Hamed Moftakhari, a civil and environmental engineer at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa who was not involved in the study. But the situation beyond a small downtown parking lot is likely to be much more complex than what the study encapsulates, he says. “I would love to see some more comprehensive representation of the cost than just parking lot transactions.”"

The birds were emaciated, and many had been molting when they perished.

Based on wind speed and direction across the Bering Sea that fall and winter, as well as the number of carcasses that washed ashore on St. Paul Island, but not on a neighboring island, the researchers estimate that between 3,150 and 8,800 birds died during that period. The deaths are probably linked to elevated sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Bering Sea, a result of human-caused climate change, the team suggests. In the past, summertime sea ice melt has helped fuel blooms of plankton that form the base of the food web in the sea (SN: 3/16/19, p. 20). But sea ice has become scarce in the Bering Sea in the last few years, and there are fewer plankton blooms. That has had cascading effects through the sea’s food web, including decreases in some species of small fish, such as capelin and herring, that puffins eat. Starvation may also have been responsible for recent mass die-offs of other seabirds in the region, such as of murres, auklets and kittiwakes."

just erode calcium carbonate shells. It can also slow the rate at which tiny
algae called diatoms build their beautiful, intricate silica cell walls. Thinner
walls mean lighter diatoms — making the algae less able to transport carbon to the deep
ocean, scientists report August 26 in
Nature Climate Change.  Vast diatom blooms act as a
biological pump in the ocean, adding oxygen to the atmosphere and drawing carbon
dioxide out of it. To protect themselves from predators, diatoms also build
houses of glass — strong cell walls of silica. When diatoms die, the walls act
as ballast, causing the creatures to sink and sequester carbon from the
atmosphere.  But as oceans absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide (SN: 6/8/19, p.
24), their waters become more acidic. If greenhouse gas emissions continue on
their current track, the average ocean pH will drop from about 8.1 to about 7.8
by 2100, says marine biologist Katherina Petrou of the University of Technology
Sydney in Australia.  What that would mean for
diatoms isn’t clear. Previous research suggests more CO2 could
increase diatoms’ productivity, helping the algae to grow faster. But Petrou
and her colleagues suspected that a lower pH might also affect how well the
algae build their glass houses. The team filled six
650-liter tanks with Antarctic seawater containing about 35 diatom species. Each
tank’s seawater was saturated with different amounts of CO2,
resulting in pH values ranging from 8.1 to 7.45.  After 12 days, diatoms in
the most acidic water were making 60 percent less new silica compared with those
in seawater with a pH of 8.1. And, in that heavily acidic tank, larger, heavier
species went from making up about 40 percent of the community to only 3 percent.
 But even at pH as high as
7.84, silica production shrank, the team found. That’s “above the pH levels
expected by 2100,” Petrou says. “Our study has exposed a new climate change
threat to the ecosystem.”"
"31","Students worldwide are striking to demand action on climate change","On March 15, students are set to attend more than 1,000 events to demand that governments do more to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/students-worldwide-are-striking-demand-action-climate-change","For the past several months, growing numbers of students around the world have been cutting class — not to play but to protest. The topic driving them is the same: Earth’s changing climate, as evidenced by increasing wildfires and droughts, rising seas and more extreme weather. As the students see it, governments have not done enough to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, to limit global warming or to plan ways to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox On March 15, this student-led protest will crescendo with a coordinated strike set to take place across the globe. More than 1,300 events are planned in 98 countries from Argentina to Vanuatu, according to a list kept by the group Fridays For Future. “These kids speak with a moral clarity and poignancy that none but the most jaded of ears can fail to hear,” says Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State. He says he believes the school-strike movement “is part of why we will soon see a tipping point on climate action here in the U.S. and around the rest of the world.” What motivates Milou Albrecht, 14, of Castlemaine, Australia, who is a coleader of strikes in her country, is worry about wildfires. When she was little, a fire quickly approached the bush country where she was playing at a friend’s house. Smoke filled the air, she recalls, and everyone had to evacuate. “You didn’t know what to take, so we didn’t take anything.” The planet’s average temperature has risen about 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times, according to a 2018 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC (SN: 12/22/18, p. 18). Human-induced global warming already has caused multiple changes in Earth’s climate, the IPCC noted in its report, pointing to more heat waves, more and heavier rains or snow events and a greater risk of drought.  If emissions continue at the current rate, the increase in average global temperatures will hit 1.5 degrees C sometime between 2030 and 2052, the IPCC says. Beyond that point, impacts will be even more severe. And the longer people wait to cut back releases of greenhouse gases, the more difficult it may be. For instance, the longer U.S. auto and energy companies wait, the higher the costs for any action would be, according to an October 2017 study in Environmental Science & Technology. Such data, many students now argue, means the time to act is now. Many young protesters have drawn inspiration from Greta Thunberg, a 16-year old Swedish teen with Asperger’s syndrome. Although this mild form of autism can leave people uncomfortable in social situations, Greta began regularly protesting outside Sweden’s Parliament during the summer of 2018. Her protests inspired the Fridays for Future movement. Greta also has encouraged kids to strike in other countries and spoke to delegates at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC), held in December in Katowice, Poland. “You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes,” Greta testified. There is still time to limit the worst impacts, she noted — but only if governments act now. “Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible,” she said, “there is no hope.” Greta’s message has spread like wildfire. Twelve-year-old Haven Coleman from Denver, a coleader of the U.S. school strikes, was inspired to act by changes she’s seen in her part of the world. “We’re affected by floods and fires, and we’ve been in a 19-year drought,” she says. Climate change will make such events more common and worsen air pollution, especially from wildfires. And that makes it even more personal for Haven: She has asthma, so breathing dirty air already causes her problems. “All ages are welcome for the climate strikes,” says the 22-year-old. “Not being a teen does not stop you from striking for climate.” The impacts of Earth’s changing climate will hit developing countries, like hers, especially hard. Many people there have limited electricity, few government services and low incomes. And residents are more likely to work outside, where they’re subject to extreme heat or other problems. These people also tend to have less money to pay for steps to adapt, such as buying and running an air conditioner. “Climate denialism is like suicide,” Nakate says of the people who argue climate change is not happening. “We cannot let ourselves perish as we look on without doing anything,” she says. “Not taking climate action is like locking yourself up in a house on fire.” If adults are the ones who need to act, why are kids protesting? “It is our generation which has the highest stake in this,” explains 15-year-old Scarlet Possnett, a Suffolk, England, teen who is an organizer of YouthStrike4Climate. A big first step is for governments to recognize climate change as a crisis, she says. And many, seemingly, do not see the urgency, she adds. Just 100 companies across the globe are responsible for 70 percent of the greenhouse gases driving climate change, Possnett notes, citing figures from a 2017 report from CDP, a British group that gathers data on pollution. Those big companies won’t reduce emissions on their own, the teen believes. To prompt them to act, she argues, “there needs to be a policy change.” But, the study points out, these cuts so far “fall a long way short” of achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which most of the world’s nations have pledged to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Doing that will require cutting emissions by roughly 25 percent over the next 10 years, Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia in England and her colleagues reported in Nature Climate Change February 25, 2019. Key to that will be huge moves “to phase out the use of fossil fuels,” the report says. Many young people can hardly remember a time when Earth’s changing climate did not threaten them, says Lilah Williamson. And going forward, “we’re not going to know a time without [its] impending doom,” says this 14-year old from Burnaby, Canada. The region where she lives has suffered from storms that have been dumping heavier rains than in the past. There also have been more droughts and wildfires. “I just can’t imagine what it’s going to be like in the future,” she says. Such students can feel burdened by a type of dread, points out Susie Burke, a psychologist in Castlemaine, Australia, and Milou’s mom. Imagining how climate change will affect them leaves many kids anxious, as well as empathetic toward others suffering from these severe events, she and her colleagues reported May 2018 in Current Psychiatry Reports in a study about the psychological impacts of climate change.   Burke supports her daughter’s protests. School strikes are a “problem-focused” way of coping with climate’s impacts, she says.. “You try to do something about the problem that is causing you stress.” The protests can reassure children and teens that they’re not alone: “Your concerns are shared by a whole bunch of people.” Learning about climate change and its impacts can seem overwhelming, says Milou. But taking part in climate protests has “felt empowering,” inspiring and even fun. And, if the global strike is any indication, getting governments to act on climate change is crucial to the next generation. As Greta told the United Nations meeting, “We have run out of excuses, and we are running out of time.”"
"32","The worst wildfires can send smoke high enough to affect the ozone layer","Pyrocumulonimbus clouds can send soot and other damaging particles 23 kilometers into the air","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worst-wildfires-can-send-smoke-high-enough-affect-ozone-layer","For the first time, scientists have seen exactly how
towering clouds that rise from intense wildfires launch smoke high into the
atmosphere, where it can linger for months and mess with the protective ozone
layer.  Cooler air closer to Earth’s surface normally keeps smoke
from rising too high. But as dozens of fires raged in western Canada and the
U.S. Pacific Northwest in the summer of 2017, they created their own giant
storm clouds called pyrocumulonimbus, or pyroCb, clouds. Within two months, these
clouds had lofted smoke 12 to 23 kilometers up into the stratosphere,
researchers report in the Aug. 9 Science.
Solar radiation heating soot in the smoke helped it reach those soaring
heights.   Using satellites, weather balloons and ground-based remote
sensing, the team tracked the smoke over the Northern Hemisphere, measuring the
levels of organics and black carbon, or soot. Smoke persisted in the
stratosphere for about eight months, says Pengfei Yu, a climate scientist at Jinan
University in Guangzhou, China. Although smoke has been observed in the stratosphere before,
this “mother of all pyroCbs” offered the first direct observation of a process called
“self-lofting,” says coauthor Alan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J.  The observations confirmed what simulations had suggested
would happen if large amounts of smoke were injected into the stratosphere via
a nuclear war, the team says. “Nature did the experiment for us,” Robock says, confirming
the “nuclear winter” scenario, in which smoke in the stratosphere from a city
burning would have far-reaching and long-lasting climatic consequences,
including blocking out sunlight and affecting ozone. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Understanding the fate of smoke particles at high altitude
“is very important for climate research,” says Yafang Cheng, an atmospheric
chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, whose research has shown that
significant amounts of wildfire soot get into the stratosphere.  Importantly, Yu and his colleagues showed that “smoke in the
stratosphere hangs around a long time,” says Loretta Mickley, an atmospheric
chemist at Harvard University. The longer the smoke stays in the stratosphere,
the more time that organics and soot in the smoke layer have to absorb sunlight
or reflect it back into space. When major volcanic eruptions in past centuries have
caused such solar reflection, she says, the dimming effect has led to crop
failures and famines.  It’s unlikely that wildfires could loft enough smoke to
cause a hemispheric dimming effect. But the smoke can damage the ozone layer,
which protects Earth from too much harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun,
in two different ways.  Most immediately, as ozone-poor smoke rises into the
stratosphere, it pushes out ozone-rich air, causing a temporary loss of ozone
in that area, Yu says. Using sensitive instruments aboard the CALIPSO
satellite, Yu’s team measured ozone losses up to 50 percent over parts of
Canada during the 2017 fires. In addition, chemical reactions with water vapor transported
into the stratosphere by wildfire smoke that take place over time can also
damage ozone. When water vapor breaks down, it releases reactive hydrogen oxide
molecules called radicals that destroy ozone. “Although we can’t say the
observed ozone [loss from these fires] is due to chemistry,” the risk of ozone
loss occurring rises if more smoke reaches into the stratosphere, Yu says.   How significant those ozone losses may be “is a big question
mark right now, but is being actively studied,” says study coauthor Michael
Fromm, a meteorologist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. PyroCbs
occur from three to six dozen times a year globally, Fromm says. But these fire
clouds range in size, with the biggest and most intense ones requiring “a
perfect storm” of hot, dry, windy conditions along with clusters of very hot
fires in close proximity in order to reach the stratosphere, he says.  Given that climate
change is increasing fire frequency and intensity in some places like the
North American West (SN: 12/22/18, p. 18),
we can probably expect to see more of these fire clouds reaching the
stratosphere, Fromm says. But, he cautions, “we are still on the learning curve
when it comes to understanding pyroCbs.” "
"33","The list of extreme weather caused by human-driven climate change grows","The tally of extreme weather events linked to climate change continues to grow, with new studies outlining links to more than a dozen events in 2017.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-extreme-weather-events-caused-human-driven-climate-change","WASHINGTON – A months-long heat wave that scorched the Tasman Sea beginning in November of 2017 is the latest example of an extreme event that would not have happened without human-caused climate change. Climate change also increased the likelihood of 15 other extreme weather events in 2017, from droughts in East Africa and the U.S. northern Plains states to floods in Bangladesh, China and South America, scientists reported December 10 at a news conference at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. The findings were also published online December 10 in a series of studies in a special issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox One study, of wildfires in Australia, was inconclusive on whether climate change influenced the event. And for the first time, none of the extreme events studied was determined to be the product of natural climate variability. The findings mark the second year in a row — and only the second time — that scientists contributing to this special issue have definitively linked human-caused climate change with specific extreme weather events (SN: 1/20/18, p. 6). To the editors of the special issue, this latest tally is representative of the new normal in which the world finds itself. “Many events were found to have appreciable climate change input; that’s not itself a surprise,” said Martin Hoerling, a special editor of the issue, at the news conference. “We are in a world that is warmer than it was in the 20th century, and we keep moving away from that baseline….” “Nature is unfolding itself in front of our eyes,” added Hoerling, a research meteorologist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo. Several marine heat waves have struck the Tasman Sea, located between Australia and New Zealand, in the last decade, including a severe heat wave during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2015 to 2016. But the 2017–2018 event extended across a much broader area, encompassing the entire sea. At its most severe point, temperatures increased to at least 2 degrees Celsius above average in the ocean, devastating the region’s iconic kelp forests and contributing to record-breaking summer temperatures in New Zealand. Climate change was also responsible for another marine heat wave off the coast of East Africa that lasted from March to June 2017, according to a separate study. That marine heat wave, which the researchers found could not have happened in a preindustrial climate, also may have contributed to a drought in East Africa that caused food shortages for millions of people in the Horn of Africa, including 6 million in Somalia alone. The hot sea surface temperatures, the researchers found, doubled the probability that such a drought would occur.   “Any given extreme event might occur, but the severity of the events, that’s really what has changed. And it’s going to continue to change,” says Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford who is part of a research group that specializes in such climate attribution studies. Haustein is a coauthor on a study included in the collection that found that climate change dramatically increased the likelihood — by as much as 100 percent — of a six-day rainstorm that inundated Bangladesh in March 2017. The rainfall, which caused a flash flood, occurred before the onset of the monsoon season and proved devastating to farmers, Haustein says. The new issue highlights how the field of climate attribution science overall has crossed a critical threshold when it comes to liability, Lindene Patton, a strategic advisor at the Earth & Water Law Group in Washington, D.C., who specializes in climate attribution, said at the news conference. Although climate change was not found to be definitively to blame in most of the studies, it very likely was responsible for or intensified the impacts of nearly every extreme event examined in the issue — and that level of statistical certainty is enough to be legally important, Patton said. “The sufficiency of certainty differs in a court of law and in science. Perfection is not required; you just need to know if it’s more likely than not.” The threat of liability may not be the ideal way to achieve more environment-friendly policies — but there is a precedent for it, she noted. “We clearly saw the emergence of liability in the 1970s with pollution” as a precursor to pollutant legislation. BAMS Editor in Chief Jeff Rosenfeld acknowledges that in a world where real-time attribution studies of events such as 2018’s Hurricane Florence are becoming more common (SN Online: 9/13/18), the detailed, retrospective analyses of the BAMS special issue that lag by a year may seem a bit slow. “The funny thing is, initially, we considered it fast response,” he says. But he thinks the looming question of climate liability highlights why the slower, more deliberate BAMS studies will continue to remain relevant, even in the swiftly changing climate of attribution science. “The people who are decision makers want numbers. They want risk factors.”"
"34","CO2 emissions are on track to take us beyond 1.5 degrees of global warming","Current and planned infrastructure will exceed the level of emissions that would keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a new analysis finds.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/co2-emissions-global-warming","A new study shows just how hard it may be to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial times. The world’s existing power plants, industrial equipment, vehicles and other CO2-emitters are on track to pump out enough carbon dioxide by midcentury to blow past that target, researchers report July 1 in Nature.  Add in future power plants that are already planned, permitted or under construction, and we could emit enough by 2033 to raise average global atmospheric temperatures by 1.5 degrees, the researchers say.   If we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, then “we cannot invest more in fossil fuel power or infrastructure,” says Thorsten Mauritsen, a physical climate scientist at Stockholm University who was not involved with the work. “Everything we do from now has to change direction and not use fossil fuels.” In the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly all the world’s nations agreed to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit warming to “well below” 2 degrees by 2100 (SN: 1/9/16, p. 6). The United States has said it would pull out of the agreement (SN Online: 6/1/17), though the exit wouldn’t be complete until 2020. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Still, calls have increased since 2015 for the more ambitious goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees. That would mean fewer heat waves, spells of extreme weather and species extinctions (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7). Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1 degree. Emitting an additional 420 to 580 gigatons of CO2 could warm the planet to 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in 2018. Current infrastructure could emit that much CO2 between 2018 and as early as 2035, though it could take until 2046 to reach those totals, the new study found. Existing infrastructure, over its expected lifetime, would emit about 658 gigatons of CO2, say Steven Davis, an earth systems scientist at the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues. About 41 percent of those emissions would come from China, 9 percent from the United States and 7 percent from the European Union. Those expected global emissions rise to about 850 gigatons when proposed power plants are included. That’s enough to hit the 1.5 degree budget by 2033, and makes up roughly two-thirds of the 1,170 to 1,500 gigatons of CO2 to reach 2 degrees of warming. “This analysis … lends some concrete context to what a 1.5 degree target would mean,” Davis says. “These targets that get bandied about are very ambitious” and will require more than a few solar power projects and incremental emissions reductions, he says. Nearly 10 years ago, Davis and some colleagues performed a census of CO2–emitting infrastructure. The new study updates that census to include all known CO2 sources at the end of 2018, including power plants and industrial emitters, such as cement kilns, as well as transportation sources such as airplanes and vehicles. The update also accounts for shifts in greenhouse gas emissions caused by things such as the U.S. natural gas boom and China’s burgeoning economy. The resulting calculation is how much CO2 is “committed” to be created, unless policy or technology triggers change. The calculations don’t consider current and future efforts to mitigate emissions, for example by expanding renewable energy sources. Nor do the results account for projected emissions increases in developing economies. This work also doesn’t consider other sectors, for instance agriculture, which contributes methane, a potent greenhouse gas, says Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London in England who was not involved with the work. Still, he says, the results should serve as a wake-up call.  “This should not be seen as a fatalistic prediction of what will happen,” Roelj says. But it’s a “strong call to ensure that we make choices that reduce the carbon impact of what is currently in the pipeline.” Editor’s note: This story was updated July 24, 2019, to clarify that the study found that, by midcentury, there would be enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to increase future temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, rather than warming reaching that benchmark midcentury."
"35","Climate change made the Arctic greener. Now parts of it are turning brown.","Arctic browning could have far-reaching consequences for people and wildlife, affecting habitat and atmospheric carbon uptake as well as increasing wildfire risk.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning","The Chugach people of southern Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula have picked berries for generations. Tart blueberries and sweet, raspberry-like salmonberries — an Alaska favorite — are baked into pies and boiled into jams. But in the summer of 2009, the bushes stayed brown and the berries never came.  For three more years, harvests failed. “It hit the communities very hard,” says Nathan Lojewski, the forestry manager for Chugachmiut, a nonprofit tribal consortium for seven villages in the Chugach region. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The berry bushes had been ravaged by caterpillars of geometrid moths — the Bruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata) and the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata). The insects had laid their eggs in the fall, and as soon as the leaf buds began growing in the spring, the eggs hatched and the inchworms nibbled the stalks bare.  Chugach elders had no traditional knowledge of an outbreak on this scale in the region, even though the insects were known in Alaska. “These berries were incredibly important. There would have been a story, something in the oral history,” Lojewski says. “As far as the tribe was concerned, this had not happened before.” At the peak of the multiyear outbreak, the caterpillars climbed from the berry bushes into trees. The pests munched through foliage from Port Graham, at the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, to Wasilla, north of Anchorage, about 300 kilometers away. In summer, thick brown-gray layers of denuded willows, alders and birches lined the mountainsides above stretches of Sitka spruce.  For more than 35 years, satellites circling the Arctic have detected a “greening” trend in Earth’s northernmost landscapes. Scientists have attributed this verdant flush to more vigorous plant growth and a longer growing season, propelled by higher temperatures that come with climate change. But recently, satellites have been picking up a decline in tundra greenness in some parts of the Arctic. Those areas appear to be “browning.” Like the salmonberry harvesters on the Kenai Peninsula, ecologists working on the ground have witnessed browning up close at field sites across the circumpolar Arctic, from Alaska to Greenland to northern Norway and Sweden. Yet the bushes bereft of berries and the tinder-dry heaths (low-growing shrubland) haven’t always been picked up by the satellites. The low-resolution sensors may have averaged out the mix of dead and living vegetation and failed to detect the browning.  Scientists are left to wonder what is and isn’t being detected, and they’re concerned about the potential impact of not knowing the extent of the browning. If it becomes widespread, Arctic browning could have far-reaching consequences for people and wildlife, affecting habitat and atmospheric carbon uptake and boosting wildfire risk.  The Arctic is warming two to three times as fast as the rest of the planet, with most of the temperature increase occurring in the winter. Alaska, for example, has warmed 2 degrees Celsius since 1949, and winters in some parts of the state, including southcentral Alaska and the Arctic interior, are on average 5 degrees C warmer.  An early effect of the warmer climate was a greener Arctic. More than 20 years ago, researchers used data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s weather satellites to assess a decade of northern plant growth after a century of warming. The team compared different wavelengths of light — red and near-infrared — reflecting off vegetation to calculate the NDVI, the normalized difference vegetation index. Higher NDVI values indicate a greener, more productive landscape. In a single decade — from 1981, when the first satellite was launched, to 1991 — the northern high latitudes had become about 8 percent greener, the researchers reported in 1997 in Nature.  The Arctic ecosystem, once constrained by cool conditions, was stretching beyond its limits. In 1999 and 2000, researchers cataloged the extent and types of vegetation change in parts of northern Alaska using archival photographs taken during oil exploration flyovers between 1948 and 1950. In new images of the same locations, such as the Kugururok River in the Noatak National Preserve, low-lying tundra plants that once grew along the riverside terraces had been replaced by stands of white spruce and green alder shrubs. At some of the study’s 66 locations, shrub-dominated vegetation had doubled its coverage from 10 to 20 percent. Not all areas showed a rise in shrub abundance, but none showed any decrease. In 2003, Howard Epstein, a terrestrial ecologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and colleagues looked to the satellite record, which now held another decade of data. Focusing on Alaska’s North Slope, which lies just beyond the crown of the Brooks Range and extends to the Beaufort Sea, the researchers found that the highest NDVI values, or “peak greenness,” during the growing season had increased nearly 17 percent between 1981 and 2001, in line with the warming trend.  As the Arctic warms up, it’s getting greener, but some pockets have been going brown instead. Satellite imagery and ecologists on the ground have observed browning in the circled areas on this map. Earth-observing satellites have been monitoring the Arctic tundra for almost four decades. In that time, the North Slope, the Canadian low Arctic tundra and eastern Siberia have become especially green, with thicker and taller tundra vegetation and shrubs expanding northward. “If you look at the North Slope of Alaska, if you look at the overall trend, it’s greening like nobody’s business,” says Uma Bhatt, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Yet parts of the Arctic, including the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of western Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (the islands north of the mainland that give Canada its pointed tip) and the northwestern Siberian tundra, show extensive browning over the length of the satellite record, from the early 1980s to 2016. “It could just be a reduction in green vegetation. It doesn’t necessarily mean the widespread death of plants,” Epstein says. Scientists don’t yet know why plant growth there has slowed or reversed — or whether the satellite signal is in some way misleading.  “All the models indicated for a long time that we would expect greening with warmer temperatures and higher productivity in the tundra, so long as it wasn’t limited in some other way, like [by lower] moisture,” says Scott Goetz, an ecologist and remote-sensing specialist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. He is also the science team lead for ABoVE, NASA’s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment, which is tracking ecosystem changes in Alaska and western Canada. “Many of us were quite surprised … that the Arctic was suddenly browning. It’s something we need to resolve.”  While global warming has propelled widespread trends in tundra greening, extreme winter weather can spur local browning events. In recent years, in some parts of the Arctic, extraordinary warm winter weather, sometimes paired with rainfall, has put tundra vegetation under enormous stress and caused plants to lose freeze resistance, dry up or die — and turn brown.  “As an ecologist, you’re thinking, ‘Whoa! Those plants would usually be nicely insulated under the snow,’ ” he says. “Suddenly, they’re being exposed because all the snow has melted. What are the consequences of that?”  Arctic plants survive frigid winters thanks to that blanket of snow and physiological changes, known as freeze resistance, that allow plants to freeze without damage. But once the plants awaken in response to physical cues of spring — warmer weather, longer days — and experience bud burst, they lose that ability to withstand frigid conditions.  Bjerke, Phoenix and other researchers continue to find brown vegetation in the wake of winter warming events. Long periods of mild winter weather have rolled over the Svalbard archipelago, the cluster of islands in the Arctic Ocean between Norway and the North Pole, in the last decade. The snow melted or blew away, exposing the ground-hugging plants. Some became encrusted in ice following a once-unheard-of midwinter rainfall. In 2015, the Arctic bell heather, whose small white flowers brighten Arctic ridges and heaths, were brown that summer, gray the next and then the leaves fell off. “It’s not new that plants can die during mild winters,” Bjerke says. “The new thing is that it is now happening several winters in a row.”  The weather needn’t always be extreme to harm plants in the Arctic. With warmer winters and summers, leaf-eating insects have thrived, defoliating bushes and trees beyond the insects’ usual range. “They’re very visual events,” says Rachael Treharne, an Arctic ecologist who completed her Ph.D. at the University of Sheffield and now works at ClimateCare, a company that helps organizations reduce their climate impact. She remembers being in the middle of an autumnal moth outbreak in northern Sweden one summer. “There were caterpillars crawling all over the plants — and us. We’d wake up with them in our beds.”  In northernmost Norway, Sweden and Finland in the mid-2000s, successive bursts of geometrid moths defoliated 10,000 square kilometers of mountain birch forest — an area roughly the size of Puerto Rico. The outbreak was one of Europe’s most abrupt and large-scale ecosystem disturbances linked to climate change, says Jane Jepsen, an Arctic ecologist at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. The Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. The higher temperatures have led to browning in some areas due to:  Extreme weatherMidwinter warming awakens plants, which then freeze as temperatures dive. Moth infestationsInsects thrive and move into new areas to eat plants. WildfiresDry plants plus more lightning leads to blackened land. “These moth species benefit from a milder winter, spring and summer climate,” Jepsen says. Moth eggs usually die at around -30° C, but warmer winters have allowed more eggs of the native autumnal moth to survive. With warmer springs, the eggs hatch earlier in the year and keep up with the bud burst of the mountain birch trees. Another species — the winter moth (O. brumata), found in southern Norway, Sweden and Finland — expanded northward during the outbreak. The spring and summer warmth favored the larvae, which ate more and grew larger, and the resulting hardier female moths laid more eggs in the fall.  While forests that die off can grow back over several decades, some of these mountain birches may have been hammered too hard, Jepsen says. In some places, the forest has given way to heathland. Ecological transitions like this could be long-lasting or even permanent, she says.  Once rare, wildfires may be one of the north’s main causes of browning. As grasses, shrubs and trees across the region dry up, they are being set aflame with increasing frequency, with fires covering larger areas and leaving behind dark scars. For example, in early 2014 in the Norwegian coastal municipality of Flatanger, sparks from a power line ignited the dry tundra heath, destroying more than 100 wooden buildings in several coastal hamlets.  Sparsely populated places, where lightning is the primary cause of wildfires, are also seeing an uptick in wildfires. Scientists say lightning strikes are becoming more frequent as the planet warms. The number of lightning-sparked fires has risen 2 to 5 percent per year in Canada’s Northwest Territories and Alaska over the last four decades, earth system scientist Sander Veraverbeke of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and his colleagues reported in 2017 in Nature Climate Change. In 2014, the Northwest Territories had 385 fires, which burned 34,000 square kilometers. The next year, 766 fires torched 20,600 square kilometers of the Alaskan interior — accounting for about half the total area burned in the entire United States in 2015.  In the last two years, wildfires sent plumes of smoke aloft in western Greenland (SN: 3/17/18, p. 20) and in the northern reaches of Sweden, Norway and Russia, places where wildfires are uncommon. Wildfire activity within a 30-year period could quadruple in Alaska by 2100, says a 2017 report in Ecography. Veraverbeke expects to see “more fires in the Arctic in the future.”  The loss of wide swaths of plants could have wide-ranging local effects. “These plants are the foundation of the terrestrial Arctic food webs,” says Isla Myers-Smith, a global change ecologist at the University of Edinburgh. The shriveled landscapes can leave rock ptarmigan, for example, which rely heavily on plants, without enough food to eat in the spring. The birds’ predators, such as the arctic fox, may feel the loss the following year.  The effects of browning may be felt beyond the Arctic, which holds about half of the planet’s terrestrial carbon. The boost in tundra greening allows the region to store, or “sink,” more carbon during the growing season. But carbon uptake may slow if browning events continue, as expected in some regions.  Treharne, Phoenix and colleagues reported in February in Global Change Biology that on the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway, extreme winter conditions cut in half the heathlands’ ability to trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the growing season.  Yet there’s still some uncertainty about how these browned tundra ecosystems might change in the long-term. As the land darkens, the surface absorbs more heat and warms up, threatening to thaw the underlying permafrost and accelerate the release of methane and carbon dioxide. Some areas might switch from being carbon sinks to carbon sources, Phoenix warns.  On the other hand, other plant species — with more or less capacity to take up carbon — could move in. “I’m still of the view that [these areas] will go through these short-term events and continue on their trajectory of greater productivity,” Goetz says. The phenomena that cause browning events — extreme winter warming, insect outbreaks, wildfires — are on the rise. But browning events are tough to study, especially in winter, because they’re unpredictable and often occur in hard-to-reach areas.  At a couple of recent workshops on Arctic browning, remote-sensing experts and ecologists tried to tackle the problem. “We’ve been talking about how to bring the two scales together,” Bhatt says. New sensors, more frequent snapshots, better data access and more computing power could help scientists zero in on the extent and severity of browning in the Arctic.  Researchers have begun using Google Earth Engine’s massive collection of satellite data, including Landsat images at a much better resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters per pixel. Improved computational capabilities also enable scientists to explore vegetation change close up. The European Space Agency’s recently launched Sentinel Earth-observing satellites can monitor vegetation growth with a pixel size of 10 meters by 10 meters. Says Myers-Smith: “That’s starting to get to a scale that an ecologist can grapple with.”  This article appears in the April 13, 2019 issue of Science News with the headline, “Arctic Browning: Warming trends bring insects, extreme weather and wildfires to land that had been going green.”"
"36","‘End Times’ explores the catastrophic events that could kill us all","A new book looks at the threats that could wipe out humankind and what can be done to counteract them.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/end-times-book-explores-catastrophic-events-that-could-kill-us-all","End Times Bryan Walsh Hachette Books, $29 Imagine if an asteroid as long as Central Park struck New York City. The impact would wipe out the city’s population, and the effects of the energy released — thousands of times more energy than was unleashed by the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan — would be felt globally. Thermal radiation would start fires around the world, boiling the oceans and kicking off a rapid change in climate that would probably kill off hundreds of species, humans included (SN: 4/27/19, p. 10). That might sound like the setup for a Hollywood disaster
movie, but it’s not total fiction. A similar scenario played out about 66
million years ago when an asteroid is believed to have hit the Yucatán
Peninsula and devastated the dinosaurs.  The probability of such a big asteroid hitting Earth in any
given year is a very small 0.000005 percent. But that’s no reason not to take
the threat seriously, given the catastrophic consequences, science journalist
Bryan Walsh persuasively argues in his new book, End Times.  Walsh believes an asteroid hurtling toward Earth,
supervolcanoes, nuclear war, human-caused climate change, disease epidemics and
bioengineered pathogens are among the greatest risks facing the future of
humankind. These existential threats, he writes, are “the disasters that could
end the human story in midsentence.” But we could eliminate or minimize those
threats now, he argues. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox In each chapter, Walsh investigates a different risk. He visits
scientists in their labs, reviews research studies and pulls from his reporting
experiences as a writer and editor at Time magazine to put each threat
in context, including what scientists are doing to combat the danger. To understand asteroids, he spends a night at Mount Lemmon
Observatory in Tucson, Ariz., where astronomers are tracking space rocks that
might intersect with Earth’s orbit. In theory, there are ways to deflect an
incoming asteroid before it slams into Earth, such as trying to change the
asteroid’s speed or approach. Walsh suggests that countries with space programs
spend more on planetary defense and start practicing asteroid deflection. NASA
and the European Space Agency have plans to do just that: In 2022, they intend
to crash a spacecraft into an asteroid to try to alter its trajectory. Describing such plans to counter extinction threats is what makes End Times stand out. It’s not just another doomsday book. Walsh offers insight into some options that are within reach, such as carbon-capture technology to pull carbon dioxide out of the air to curb the effects of climate change (SN: 12/22/18 & 1/5/19, p. 18).  He also discusses more theoretical solutions that scientists have thought up, like how to cool magma beneath a supervolcano to prevent an eruption. Drilling nearly 10 kilometers into the belly of a supervolcano to inject cold water may not really be practical and could cost about $3.5 billion. But offering solutions that seem fantastical is still important, Walsh argues, “because doing so demands that we step outside our brief human time frame.” Thinking big about how we could protect the future of our species might lead to more feasible plans of action. End Times isn’t all doom and gloom. Walsh adds some lightness to otherwise grim visions of humankind’s future by sprinkling in humor and colorful anecdotes throughout the book, like a story about his visit to an insect food fair. He learned how eating bugs could be a viable food option if a small group of humans were to survive a catastrophic event. “It might actually take the end of the world for me to eat the tarantula tempura, a battered, fist-sized arachnid on a plate that I can still see in my nightmares,” he writes.  Ultimately, End Times serves as a wake-up call, letting people know that “we’re not helpless in the face of those threats,” Walsh writes. “Whether we endure or die will come down chiefly to our own decisions.” Let’s hope we make the right ones.

"37","Mercury levels in fish are rising despite reduced emissions","Climate change and overfishing can increase how much mercury accumulates in fish, counteracting efforts to reduce human-caused emissions.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-levels-fish-are-rising-despite-reduced-emissions","Climate change and overfishing may be hampering efforts to reduce toxic mercury accumulations in the fish and shellfish that end up on our plates. Mercury emissions are decreasing around the globe. But new research suggests that warmer ocean waters and fishing’s effects on ecosystems can alter how much mercury builds up in seafood. Fishing practices increased methylmercury levels in the tissue of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) caught in the Gulf of Maine by as much as 23 percent over a roughly 30-year period, researchers estimate. That’s despite decreases in atmospheric mercury levels over the same time period, from the 1970s to the 2000s. The finding is based on simulations of mercury emissions as well as ecosystem changes related to fishing. It reveals how the diet of cod, driven by the rebound of once-overfished herring, plays an important role in determining how much mercury accumulates in the fish, the team reports online August 7 in Nature. The scientists also created simulations of the effects of warming seawater on mercury bioaccumulation, incorporating changing emissions and temperatures as well as mercury accumulations measured in Gulf of Maine Atlantic bluefin tuna since 1969. Those simulations suggest that seawater temperature increases could be responsible for as much as a 56 percent increase in methylmercury concentrations found in Gulf of Maine Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the team found. “This is really the first investigation to look at migratory marine fish and the potential impacts of temperature and overfishing” at the same time, says study coauthor Elsie Sunderland, an environmental chemist at Harvard University. Scientists have long assumed that when it comes to mercury piling up in seafood, the only factor that matters is how much is being sent into the sky, she says. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Simulations suggest that the level of methylmercury in Gulf of Maine seawater has decreased since the 1970s, thanks to more regulation of emissions from coal-fired power plants (below).  Methylmercury in Gulf of Maine seawater A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 But measured seawater temperatures are increasing around the globe, and the Gulf of Maine waters are warming particularly quickly relative to the global average (below).  Gulf of Maine temperature deviation from global average A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 Those effects impact how much mercury accumulates in Atlantic bluefin tuna caught in the region, simulations show (below). If emissions alone were considered, tuna mercury levels should follow the trend of the dotted line – first rising after the 1970s and then dropping off. But new research reveals that mercury levels in tuna depend on both emissions and water temperatures (solid line), with an early peak related to emissions and then a steady increase since about 2000 that corresponds to rising seawater temperatures.  Effect of water mercury levels and temperature on tuna A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 Emissions do matter, but are only one piece of the puzzle. Mercury emissions, as inorganic mercury, can come from both human activities such as burning coal or natural sources like volcanoes. Eventually, that mercury rains back down onto Earth’s surface. Microorganisms then convert the mercury into an organic form called methylmercury that can cling to organic matter. When tiny creatures consume that matter, the metal gets stored in their fatty tissues. And so on up the food chain: As increasingly larger animals eat methylmercury-laden dinners, more and more of the metal accumulates in the predators. In oceans, this toxic trek can go from zooplankton to small fish and crustaceans, then bigger fish and, finally, people. That accumulation can be deadly: Methylmercury poisoning can damage the central nervous and digestive systems, causing cognitive damage, kidney failure and death. The good news is that emissions are no longer on the rise. From 1990 to 2010, mercury emissions from human activities decreased from 2,890 megagrams per year to 2,280 megagrams per year. Emissions, particularly from the European Union and the United States, continue to decline, according to a global assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme. A 2017 global treaty to reduce emissions could lower those numbers further. In the United States, mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants dropped from about 41,700 kilograms in 2006 to about 6,300 kilograms in 2016, a decrease of 85 percent. That decrease is the direct result of state regulations on emissions and, later, a 2011 federal standard, Sunderland says. But, surprisingly, that hasn’t led to a straightforward decrease in the mercury measured in fish. Some fish in the Gulf of Maine, such as Atlantic cod, showed increases in mercury in their tissues over time, the team found. Others, including the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), showed decreases. To try to solve that mystery, biogeochemist Amina Schartup of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and colleagues zoomed in more closely on the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. The area has a long history of intense scrutiny, both as a historical fishing ground as a hot spot for global warming. Seawater temperatures there are among the fastest rising in the world. The team looked at methylmercury levels in seawater, sediments and across the ecosystem. The researchers also wanted to compare these data with changes in the diets of Atlantic cod and spiny dogfish through time. To do this, the team analyzed the stomach contents of the two species from the 1970s and 2000s, using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s extensive records on fish stocks in the region. Mercury differences between the two types of fish were directly related to diet changes resulting from humans’ fishing habits, the researchers found. Cod and dogfish both prefer to eat herring, but in the 1970s, herring populations in the region collapsed due to overfishing. So the cod turned to smaller herring, which have relatively lower mercury levels, and the dogfish turned to heavily mercury-laden squid. But then herring came back on the menu as its populations rebounded after the 1970s. Dogfish ate fewer squid, and their mercury increases slowed. Cod, on the other hand, saw a more dramatic increase in mercury accumulation. Seawater temperatures in the Gulf of Maine may also alter mercury accumulation. Using calculations of energy expenditure, growth and prey consumption for Atlantic bluefin tuna, the researchers estimated how much warming waters increase fish activity. More active fish consume more food and accumulate more mercury, which could explain higher than expected mercury levels measured in the fish given declining emissions, the scientists suggest.   Next, the team plans to expand these simulations beyond the Gulf of Maine, Sunderland says. “That’s really the goal,” she says. “To understand the changing impacts for all these ecosystems.” William Cheung, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, says another step will be to link these findings to public health, and to make projections for future seafood safety. “It’s a really important piece of work,” he says. “Historically, we’ve only looked at these problems individually: climate change, overfishing, contamination…. We may be underestimating the level of risk and impacts.” But efforts to project those risks going forward is a task made trickier by some uncertainty in future mercury emissions, particularly from the United States. In December 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed weakening its mercury regulations, suggesting that they are no longer “appropriate or necessary.” Yet those regulations “are a tremendous environmental success story,” Sunderland says. Rolling those regulations back could undo a lot of the good that they have done, she says. “The situation would be much worse without them.”"
"38","How today’s global warming is unlike the last 2,000 years of climate shifts","Temperatures at the end of the 20th century were hotter almost everywhere on the planet than in the previous two millennia.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-today-unlike-last-2000-years-climate-shifts","Temperatures across 98 percent of Earth’s surface were hotter at the end of the 20th century than at any time in the previous 2,000 years. Such nearly universal warming, occurring in lockstep across the planet, is unique to this current era, scientists say. By contrast, other well-known cold and warm snaps of the past, such as the Little Ice Age or the Medieval Warm Period, were, in fact, regional rather than worldwide. What’s more, the rate at which temperatures are increasing now far exceeds any previous temperature fluctuations measured in the last two millennia. Those are the conclusions of a trio of new papers examining temperature trends over the last 2,000 years, published online July 24 in Nature and Nature Geoscience. Those previous climate fluctuations were primarily driven by natural causes, including powerful volcanic eruptions, rather than human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.   Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The findings, which are based on newly available global paleoclimate data, reinforce an inescapable conclusion, says Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University who was not involved in the new studies: “The current period of warmth is unprecedented in its global scope in the last 2,000 years.” In the Nature study, a team led by Raphael Neukom, a climate scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, used many different types of temperature records from around the world to create thousands of climate reconstructions of the last two millennia, from A.D. 1 to 2000. Those data were collected by an international group of scientists called the PAGES 2k Consortium. They include proxies for temperatures derived from tree rings, glacier ice cores, lake and ocean sediments, cave deposits such as stalactites and stalagmites and historical documents (SN: 10/28/17, p. 29). Using those data, as well as direct temperature measurements collected in some locations since the 1800s and some climate simulations, the team produced more than 15,000 different climate reconstructions of past global temperatures. Then, the researchers took a close look at the precise timing of warming or cooling within four previously identified “climate epochs” — the Roman Warm Period from about A.D. 1 to 300, the Dark Ages Cold Period from 400 to 800, the Medieval Warm Period from about 800 to 1200 and the Little Ice Age from 1300 to 1850. Well-known climate fluctuations of the last 2,000 years were once thought to be global. But research using newly available temperature proxy data from around the planet reveals that these fluctuations were regional. In each map, different colors represent the warmest (or coldest) century for a given location within the represented time period. For example, the Dark Ages Cold Period is thought to span from about A.D. 400 to 800. But colder temperatures occurred several hundred years earlier in the Pacific Ocean (white to pale purple) and several hundred years later in East Asia and other locations (darker purple). Similarly, the Medieval Warm Period (or Medieval Climate Anomaly) lasted roughly from 800 to 1200, with peak warmth occurring during the 11th century in northwestern Europe (orange). But central South America saw peak warmth several hundred years later (brown). Across all 2,000 years included in the new research, however, temperatures were hottest at the end of the 20th century for 98 percent of the planet (shown in the third map). Cold and warm snaps of the past were regional, unlike current global warming Although the same datasets were input into the climate reproductions, the team used different methodologies, varying widely in computational complexity, to process the data and calculate past temperatures. Regardless of which method was used, the story was the same, the researchers found: Those past climate epochs were not simultaneous, global events. The Little Ice Age, for example, was a cold snap thought to have lasted from roughly 1350 to 1850. But the deep freezes didn’t occur everywhere at the same time, the new analysis shows. Northwestern Europe and southeastern North America got their coldest temperatures during the 17th century, while the area encompassing the central and eastern Pacific Ocean were coldest two hundred years earlier, during the 15th century, the team found. The Medieval Warm Period, also called the Medieval Climate Anomaly, showed the warmest temperatures in northwestern Europe and eastern North America during the 11th century. But peak warmth occurred several hundred years later in central South America, and several hundred years earlier in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. “The traditional understanding is that these [climate epochs, like the Little Ice Age] were global-scale phenomena,” says Nathan Steiger, a climate scientist at Columbia University. “That’s not the case.” That finding stands in stark contrast to the team’s conclusions about the current era of warming: It is occurring concurrently around the globe, with the hottest temperatures in the study found to be right at the end of the 20th century. “It is coherent in a way we didn’t experience over the last 2,000 years,” Steiger says. Because the study’s temperature data go only to 2000, the last two decades of temperatures weren’t included. But NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported in February that nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the last five years were the five hottest on record (SN Online: 2/6/19). Human activities have been repeatedly cited by scientists as the cause of these ongoing record-breaking temperatures (SN Online: 7/2/19). At a news conference on July 22, Steiger noted that the Nature study didn’t specifically mention that the current warming is due to anthropogenic activities, in part because so many previous studies have repeatedly and clearly demonstrated that link. “We don’t need to look at paleoclimate to know that.” A second study, published in Nature Geoscience, does address the question of anthropogenic warming more explicitly. The study, authored by Neukom and other members of the PAGES 2k Consortium, used the same temperature proxies as the Nature study. But instead of comparing spatial patterns of warming and cooling around the globe, the team looked at the average global temperature through time. That, Neukom said at the news conference, revealed that the current rate of warming is much faster than anything observed in the last 2,000 years that can be attributed to natural variability. “It’s another angle to look at the extraordinary nature of current warming,” he said. A third study, also in Nature Geoscience, added another layer of context to the trends, by looking at what natural forces may have been behind large regional temperature fluctuations such as the Little Ice Age. Led by University of Bern climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann, the researchers found that before the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1800s, powerful volcanic eruptions were the main engine behind such large-scale temperature fluctuations. For instance, five powerful eruptions, including the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, occurred toward the end of the Little Ice Age, which began around 1350 and ended around 1850 (SN: 7/7/18, p. 32). The eruptions initially led to cooling and climate upheaval, and then a period of recovery as the planet warmed up again. That recovery coincides with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, at which point greenhouse gases became the primary driver for warming, the researchers note. Mann notes that the studies’ findings — that these past climate epochs weren’t global and that current warming is proceeding at an unprecedented rate — aren’t exactly new ideas. In 1998, he and colleagues published a famous study in Nature, sometimes referred to as the “hockey stick” paper, that revealed a dramatic upward tick in temperatures at the end of the 20th century — a pattern that, when plotted through time, takes the shape of a hockey stick. “It’s gratifying that independent, international teams using entirely different approaches have come to virtually identical conclusions,” Mann says. Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who coauthored the hockey stick study, agrees. “In that paper, we were widely criticized for saying the last decade was the warmest in the last 1,000 years,” he says. Bradley adds that the new studies are a valuable addition, with a “high quality, carefully screened set of data” as well as powerful simulations that can synthesize and reproduce those past temperatures. “They’ve done everything right,” he adds. But the PAGES 2k database of temperature proxies still contains some glaring holes, particularly in tropical regions and in the oceans. Such data won’t change the underlying storyline, but could help scientists see global temperature fluctuations even more clearly, Bradley says. Efforts to collect more temperature data from South America are already afoot, from cave formations across Brazil and Argentina as well as from ancient trees in the Amazon forest, he adds, and “that’s exactly what’s needed.”"
"39","‘The Human Element’ makes the impacts of climate change feel real","Photographer James Balog puts a human face on the impacts of climate change in the documentary The Human Element.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-element-makes-impacts-climate-change-feel-real","Climate change, extreme weather events and debates over climate mitigation strategies dominated the news for much of the last year. Yet climate scientists continually wrestle with how best to talk about these issues: Should discussions of climate change appeal directly to people’s emotions, whether fear or anger or even hope? Or are data-driven discussions the way to go? There is no one answer, of course. But The Human Element, a documentary starring photographer James Balog, aims directly for the gut by putting a human face on the impacts. The movie, now streaming online, shows how human-caused climate change is intersecting with people’s lives. For instance, we see flooded homes in Florida in the wake of Hurricane Irma in 2017. Global warming probably increased Irma’s intense rainfall, researchers have found. We also see firefighters battling wildfires in the American West (the movie is almost entirely shot in the United States). “I felt a great sense of urgency to bear witness,” Balog says in the film. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox That collision of people and planet is something that Balog, also the subject of the 2012 documentary Chasing Ice, has been capturing in photographs for decades. In The Human Element, his work is framed through the four ancient elements: earth, air, fire and water. People, Balog suggests, are a fifth element — a force of nature, too. People are driving climate change, and their lives are being altered by it. It is in showing the faces of those directly affected by our tampering with nature that the movie packs its most powerful punches. After capturing the desolation of a family standing in knee-deep water inside their home in Irma’s aftermath, the film shows other water-related impacts, particularly the plight of the residents of Tangier Island in Virginia, which is being rapidly and inexorably swallowed by the rising waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The air segment focuses on how humans are altering the atmosphere, specifically with such pollution as volatile organic compounds emitted by planes, cars, trucks and facilities that process oil and gas. One heart-wrenching scene takes Balog to a school in Denver that specializes in treating kids with asthma, a condition often triggered by pollution. The kids are trained to treat themselves during an asthma attack; many do so several times a day. In the fire segment, Balog photographs firefighters as they wearily but valiantly tackle the 2016 Soberanes Fire near Big Sur, Calif. With a price tag of $260 million, the blaze is among the most expensive ever battled in the United States. In the film, geographer Tania Schoennagel of the University of Colorado Boulder notes that climate change, as well as the increasing encroachment of human communities into former wilderness (SN: 12/22/18 & 1/5/19, p. 8), is already transforming the wildfire season. Since the 1970s, she says, there has been a 1,000 percent increase in the frequency of megafires — fires burning at least 40,000 hectares — in parts of the western United States. Finally, the earth segment brings Balog to the coal-mining country of Kentucky and Pennsylvania — where, he says, “what we’ve dug from the Earth and burned has changed the other ‘elements.’ ” Balog, whose grandfather died while mining coal, paints a grim picture of how a fading industry with dwindling jobs has left former miners in dire straits. But the segment ends on a rare note of hope — and offers the film’s only nod at climate mitigation efforts. Balog follows a pair of developers who are planning to build a massive solar energy farm on reclaimed coal-mining land in hopes of bringing new jobs to the impoverished area. The Human Element also doesn’t dwell for long on actual climate science, though the scientists who appear throughout provide helpful context for each of the movie’s segments. What the film does do, and does well, is tell a series of human stories, accompanied by Balog’s haunting photos. The combination of stories and images is indeed an effective, powerful way to communicate the impacts of climate change. FORCE OF NATURE  Watch the trailer for The Human Element."
"40","How the 5 riskiest U.S. cities for coastal flooding are preparing for rising tides","The five U.S. cities most at risk of coastal flooding from rising sea levels are in various stages of preparedness.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-five-us-coastal-cities-risk-flooding-rising-sea-levels","The five U.S. cities most at risk from coastal flooding have begun to make plans for adapting to rising sea levels. Some are further along than others. Here’s where their flood resilience efforts stand: Florida’s flooding risk comes not just from storms and high tides but also from water seeping up through the porous limestone that underlies much of the state. After 2017’s Hurricane Irma caused more than $50 billion in damage, Miami residents voted in favor of a new tax to fund coastal flooding resilience projects across the city. The first project, in the city’s low-lying Fair Isle neighborhood, broke ground in March and will construct a drainage collection system and raise roadways. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit New York City with a 3.4-meter storm tide, causing over $19 billion in damage. Although there are now several programs to guide rebuilding and resiliency efforts, few adaptation projects have come to fruition, says Robert Freudenberg, an environmental planner with the Regional Plan Association in New York City. In March, the New York City Panel on Climate Change released a report and new flooding maps. In May, the city’s Office of Emergency Management began installing sandbags around lower Manhattan as a temporary measure to protect the waterfront while more permanent solutions are considered. Louisiana is one of the most flood-prone states, thanks to a combination of rising sea level, sinking landmass and the floodprone natures of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. Sinking in particular is a major problem as the river sediments that once replenished coastal land are blocked by levees, unable to refill riverbanks and estuaries. Since 1930, nearly 5,000 square kilometers of land have been inundated with water, with 10,000 square kilometers imperiled in the next 50 years. This loss of protective marshland leaves New Orleans more exposed to Gulf storms and flooding. In May, Louisiana released a $40 billion plan called LA SAFE to build needed levees, restore shorelines and, if necessary, relocate entire communities at risk from flooding. The first LA SAFE projects are slated for completion in 2022. Like much of southern Florida, the Tampa Bay region already sees regular flooding during high tides and storms. Since 1952, sea levels in Tampa Bay are up by about 18 centimeters. In April, Tampa’s Climate Science Advisory Panel recommended that the city begin preparing for seas to rise an extra 30 to 76 centimeters by 2050 and 60 to 260 centimeters by 2100. Those ranges are NOAA’s predictions for sea level rise, depending on different climate change scenarios. A timeline for starting adaptation projects hasn’t been announced. With neighborhood-level projections for future sea level rise in hand, the city of Boston has district-level projects completed for East Boston, Charlestown and South Boston. A deployable flood wall is being installed along the East Boston Greenway and a section of Main Street in Charlestown is being elevated to protect the adjacent neighborhood. In several areas, including around South Boston and the Seaport, concrete is being removed and replaced by floodable parks and green space. Mayor Martin Walsh has pledged 10 percent of the city’s $3.49 billion capital budget in 2020 for such resiliency projects."

to prevent wildfires, which are once again raging across California, have
plunged vast parts of the state into darkness.  Millions
of people lost power in October in a series of deliberate blackouts intended to
preempt power lines from sparking wildfires in especially dry, windy
conditions. Cell towers died, leaving many without phone service. Traffic lights
blinked out. Hospitals scrambled to keep lifesaving equipment running on backup
generators.  While
disruptive, the cautionary electricity outages starting October 9 were meant to
ward off something even more disastrous. In 2017 and 2018, wildfire season
caused record-breaking destruction. Hundreds of fires in California in 2018
alone are thought to have been sparked by equipment run by power supply
companies. Many were relatively small and easily put out, but others were more
catastrophic — including the deadliest fire in California’s history, known as
the Camp Fire, which killed more than 80 people and leveled the town of
Paradise last November.  With wildfire risks increasing as climate change leaves the landscape increasingly
parched (SN: 7/15/15), mass power
outages could become the new normal — unless the electricity system can be made
more fire-safe. Science News asked
two experts in energy infrastructure how to improve the power grid so it poses
less of a threat amid heightened wildfire risks.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox “Putting
lines underground is a great solution. It’s also very pricy,” says Alexandra
von Meier of the University of California, Berkeley. “Instead of a million
dollars a mile, you’re looking at 10 million dollars. In places where there’s
many miles of exposed or vulnerable terrain, that’s a big price tag.”  To
avoid breaking the bank, though, utilities could bury lines only in areas that
are particularly vulnerable to future wildfires, says Sayanti Mukherjee of the
University of Buffalo in New York, who is working on a wildfire risk analysis
for different counties in California.  Power
line networks are sprawling, ferrying electricity over long distances.
California’s biggest power company alone, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.,
supplies some 5 million customers in the state’s central and northern areas.
And while some communities spread farther into fire-prone woodlands and prairies (SN:
11/15/18), even customers in relatively fire-safe areas are still served by
transmission lines that cut through tinderlike terrain, such as grass-covered
hills. So those homes have to be unplugged as well.  The grid
could be redesigned to feed electricity into smaller, more isolated
“microgrids,” Mukherjee says. “The key benefit of a microgrid is that it can go
into ‘island mode’” — disconnecting from the main power grid and switching to a
local energy source in an emergency. “That way, we can prevent mass power
outages for thousands of people who aren’t even getting directly affected by
the wildfires,” she says. Today, microgrids are largely used by airports,
university campuses or companies, and typically rely on gas or diesel backup generators.
 Historically,
utilities “have relied a lot on physical inspections” of vast power line
networks, von Meier says. “There’s now really a movement to begin to apply more
advanced computer science techniques” to analyze data about electrical activity
across the grid to identify remote disturbances, such as tree branches getting
too close to power lines. Plants touching electrical equipment sparked at least one of the blazes that contributed to the Camp Fire inferno.  Sensors
installed along power lines could monitor environmental conditions, such as wind and air temperature, which
can raise alarms about possible new fires or warn where they might spread (SN: 9/9/18).  “I’m
expecting to see more power shutoffs, and to see that continue next year and
the year after,” says von Meier, who is working with colleagues to develop a
microgrid system where multiple homes on a city block could share energy from household
solar panels. Meanwhile, there are microgrid pilot projects, such as the San
Diego Gas and Electric Company’s microgrid in Borrego Springs, which can
function independently during power outages.  But replicating
such efforts in more places “does take time, and it does take money,” she says.
“It will be a decade before they’re widespread.” "
"42","Ancient crystal growths in caves reveal seas rose 16 meters in a warmer world","The Pliocene era cave formations on the Spanish coast of Mallorca offer hints about how oceans could respond to human-driven climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-crystal-growth-caves-reveal-seas-rose-16-meters-warmer-world","The
future of sea level rise may be written into the walls of coastal Spanish caves. Mineral
“bathtub rings” deposited inside the limestone Artà Caves on
the Balearic island of Mallorca show how high seas rose during the
Pliocene Epoch — a time when Earth was
about as warm as it’s expected to get by 2100. Those mineral deposits suggest the
planet’s seas were
around 16 meters higher on average than they are today,
researchers report August 30 in Nature.
 That measurement provides the most precise peek yet
into what may come as climate change causes ice sheets to melt and ocean waters
to rise — a process that could happen
over hundreds to thousands of years. Previous estimates of Pliocene sea levels gave
similar results, but relied on more indirect dating methods or failed to
incorporate information about the subsequent rise and fall of the Earth’s
crust. The Artà analysis, however, takes that rise and fall into account.  The new study’s combination of precision dating and corrected
sea levels also may help answer a crucial question: How much of Earth’s biggest
ice sheet melted during the Pliocene? These sea level measurements suggest that,
while smaller ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica melted severely, only
the parts of the massive eastern Antarctic ice sheet that jutted into the sea
melted during that era, says Alan Haywood, a paleoclimatologist
at Leeds University in England who was not
involved in the study. It’s still unclear, however, how today’s unique warming
patterns will affect ice sheets. “Anything that gives us added information on how
sensitive the ice sheets are … is going to be very important,” Haywood says. Conditions during the Pliocene, 5.33 million to 2.58
million years ago, may offer the best example of what a human-addled
climate will eventually look like (SN:
11/28/17). In the past, paleoclimatologists mainly
used two approaches in reconstructing Pliocene sea level changes. One links ratios
of two types of oxygen, or isotopes, in fossilized sea creatures to a global
record of oxygen ratios and ice sheet cycles. The other uses the ages of ancient
coral reefs to estimate ancient sea levels. For the new study, researchers searched
caves for evidence of past sea level change (SN:
4/15/13). “Caves are a very protected environment,”
says study coauthor Oana-Alexandra Dumitru, a geochemist at the University of South Florida in Tampa who began
collaborating with Mallorcan researchers as a
graduate student. “We don’t worry about erosion and other weathering after
deposition as much as you would about terrestrial or other records.”  In the 1970s, Mallorcan researchers found aragonite and calcite deposits on stalactites and
stalagmites in the Artà Caves. The deposits, called phreatic overgrowths,
accumulate over years when brackish seawater laps against the rock. Similar features
have been found in coastal caves on the Italian island of Sardinia and in Mexico
and Japan. Early dating attempts in the 1990s and 2000s focused on samples only
a few hundreds of thousands of years old. But Dumitru and colleagues used a
dating method capable of reaching back further in time, comparing ratios of
uranium to lead in the minerals, to determine when the much older Pliocene deposits
formed. As Earth’s temperatures rose, higher levels of seawater
washed into the caves. That rising water left behind mineral deposits at
heights from 14.7 to 23.5 meters above today’s sea level, Dumitru’s team found.
 One of the lower deposits corresponds with the mid-Piacenzian
Warm Period, which lasted from about 3.3 million to 3 million years ago. Global
temperatures during that time period were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius warmer than in
modern, preindustrial times —
and resemble leading forecasts for the year 2100. Global mean sea levels then were
16.2 meters higher than today, Dumitru and colleagues calculate.  The higher of the six mineral deposits studied corresponds to the Pliocene’s warmest period about 4.39 million years ago, when temperatures were about 4 degrees C higher than in preindustrial times. That Artà sample suggests that seas were about 23.5 meters higher than today. “We still may not know exactly how much sea level rose,” Haywood says. But with results like these, “we’re getting more confidence that we’re in the right ballpark.”  "

Here are 5 ways we speed up extinctions","One million of the world’s plant and animal species are now under threat of extinction, a new report finds.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/1-million-species-under-threat-humans-speed-extinction","Stories about individual species on the brink of extinction may be all too familiar. But a new tally now reveals the breadth of the conservation crisis: One million of the world’s species are now poised to vanish, some as soon as within the next few decades. That number, which amounts to 1 in every 8 animal or plant species on Earth, comes from a sweeping new analysis of about 15,000 studies conducted within the last 50 years on topics ranging from biodiversity to climate to the health of ecosystems. During that time, the human population has doubled, increasing from 3.7 billion in 1970 to 7.6 billion today. And people are behind the looming losses, an international group of scientists says. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Thanks to human activities, the rate of global species extinctions is tens to hundreds of times faster than the average extinction rate was over the last 10 million years, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, or IPBES, concludes in a summary of the study published May 6. The intergovernmental group, which has 132 nations as members including the United States, will release its full 1,500-page report in about six months. The report contains many other sobering numbers: More than 40 percent of amphibian species are threatened, along with 33 percent of marine mammals, 33 percent of sharks and reef-building corals and 10 percent of insects. Right now, the rate of global species extinctions is tens to hundreds of times faster than the average extinction rate was over the last 10 million years. And if human activities continue unabated, the rate of extinctions will continue to accelerate, the report states. Here are the top five ways that people are speeding up the losses: The top threat to species on land due to humans is habitat loss, the report says. About 75 percent of land on Earth has been “severely altered” by human actions. Since 1992, urban areas have grown by more than 100 percent. Elsewhere, agriculture to feed the world’s growing population has taken over many once-diverse habitats such as old-growth forests, wetlands and grasslands. The report notes that 85 percent of wetlands that were present in 1700 were lost by 2000, and that forests now cover just 68 percent of the area they covered in preindustrial times. What’s more, the production of food crops is up by 300 percent since 1970, and in the world’s tropical regions, agricultural lands expanded by 100 million hectares from 1980 to 2000. In Southeast Asia, palm oil plantations have edged out once-intact forests, while in Central America, cattle ranches have expanded into forested areas (SN Online: 9/13/18). Habitat loss is a problem in the oceans, too — about 66 percent of the ocean surface area has been altered by human actions, the report finds. But the top threat to marine creatures from people is overexploitation. Industrial fishing spans more than 55 percent of the ocean’s surface area, and about 33 percent of the ocean’s fish stocks are being harvested at unsustainable levels. Among the world’s most overfished species are Atlantic halibut, bluefin tuna and all types of sharks. Other species, such as dolphins and loggerhead turtles, suffer as bycatch when they are inadvertently trapped during fishing activities. The world has already warmed by an average of about 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times (SN: 12/22/18, p. 18). That warming is linked to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as floods, fires and droughts, as well as to rising seas and to shifts in where species are distributed around the globe (SN: 1/19/19, p. 7). And warmer ocean waters are also placing stress on many fish populations, reducing the amount of fish that can be caught sustainably, without doing long-term damage to populations (SN: 3/30/19, p. 5). Land-use changes are also tied to climate change: Land clearing, crop production and the use of fertilizers currently account for about 25 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Three-quarters of those emissions come from animal-based foods (SN: 7/7/18, p. 10). And as a result of decreasing diversity, some tropical forests are contributing more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than they are absorbing (SN: 10/28/17, p. 9). Among the worst recent offenders is marine plastic pollution, which has increased tenfold since 1980 and affects at least 267 species, including 86 percent of marine turtles, 44 percent of seabirds and 43 percent of marine mammals, the report states (SN Online: 3/22/18). Plastics, particularly microplastics, can find their way into soils, too (SN: 5/12/18, p. 14). And other kinds of pollution are still a problem, including untreated urban and rural waste, mining and agricultural waste and oil spills (SN: 3/17/18, p. 5). Thanks to global trade and travel, humans have introduced invasive species to vulnerable areas around the world: Across 21 countries with the most detailed records, the number of invasive species per country has increased by about 70 percent since 1970, the report finds. Those invaders not only compete with native species for water and other resources, but also — like the frog-killing chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (SN: 4/27/19, p. 5) or the tree-munching emerald ash borer — can wipe out vast numbers of native animals or plants. Humans can still slow the loss of species, the researchers note. Conservation investments from 1996 to 2008 have already reduced the extinction risk for mammals and birds in 109 countries by 29 percent.  But saving more species will require “transformative changes” in behavior, the report states, including how people consume energy, food and water, and how they use land and technology."

Bursts of warm, dry wind cascading over mountains that run along the peninsula are largely to blame, researchers report April 11 in Geophysical Research Letters. In this March 2016 satellite image, meltwater on part of Larsen C can be seen at the foothills of these mountains, just one case of this type of wind-induced melting. Eastward-flowing winds sweeping across the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes pick up enough speed to surmount its mountain peaks. As the air rises and chills, its moisture condenses and, in the process, reheats the air. So when the now-dry air comes coursing down the leeway mountainside, it can be a balmy 20° Celsius. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Researchers “have told me they’ve been in a T-shirt” while standing in these winds, says cryospheric scientist Tri Datta of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.  Datta and her team compared satellite data collected from 1982 to 2017 with simulations of the peninsula’s ice sheet and atmospheric conditions during the same period. The team found that, since 2015, these winds called foehns have caused a lot of melting on the peninsula, including on Larsen C, as late as May, well into Antarctica’s autumn. Foehns likely cause 60 percent of the total snowmelt on the northeastern part of the peninsula at that time of year, Datta says. That’s a problem because meltwater can trickle into crevasses on Larsen C. The water’s own weight wedges the cracks open and may help cause the ice shelf to break off. Late melting can also prevent new snow from replenishing the ice shelf. In 2017, a giant iceberg broke from Larsen C, raising questions about the shelf’s stability and how it may contribute to rising seas (SN: 8/5/17, p. 6). It’s still unclear what’s driving these foehns and if they’re linked to climate change. And Datta emphasizes that three years is too short to constitute a trend. But without Larsen C, which buttresses multiple glaciers, glacial ice flow to the ocean could accelerate and contribute to rising global sea levels. "
"46","Half a degree stole the climate spotlight in 2018","Climate attribution studies and new data on global warming targets put climate change in the spotlight this year.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir","The grim reality of climate change grabbed center stage in 2018. This is the year we learned that the 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming won’t be enough to forestall significant impacts of climate change. And a new field of research explicitly attributed some extreme weather events to human-caused climate change. This one-two punch made it clear that climate change isn’t just something to worry about in the coming decades. It’s already here. This looming problem was apparent three years ago when nearly all of the world’s nations agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial times by 2100 (SN: 1/9/16, p. 6). That pact was hard-won, but even then, some scientists sounded a note of caution: That target wouldn’t be stringent enough to prevent major changes. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox So the United Nations took an unprecedented step. It commissioned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to examine how the world might fare if global warming were limited to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees. That report, released in October, confirmed that half a degree can indeed make a world of difference (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7). A half degree less warming means less sea level rise, fewer species lost due to vanished habitats and fewer life-threatening heat, drought and precipitation extremes (SN: 6/9/18, p. 6). There’s little time to reverse course. The IPCC report notes that the planet’s average temperature has already increased by nearly 1 degree since preindustrial times, and that rise is contributing to extinctions, lower crop yields and more frequent wildfires. At the end of 2017, three attribution studies for the first time determined that certain extreme events, including an extended marine heat wave in the Pacific Ocean known as “the Blob,” would not have happened without human-induced climate change (SN: 1/20/18, p. 6). Capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels rather than 2 degrees can soften climate impacts.  Source: IPCC 2018 This year, researchers reported that the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season got a boost from warm waters in the tropical Atlantic, fueled by climate change (SN Online: 9/28/18). And a team of scientists determined that climate change was the engine behind September’s intense rainfall from Hurricane Florence in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States (SN Online: 9/13/18). A report released November 23 by hundreds of U.S. climate scientists from 13 federal agencies put a price tag on many of the effects for the United States (SN Online: 11/28/18). The report predicts the country’s economy will shrink by as much as 10 percent by 2100 if global warming continues on its current trajectory. Climate simulations suggest that Earth will reach the 1.5 degree threshold within a decade. And even if countries were to agree to limit warming to that level, the planet would almost certainly surpass it before the warming reversed, due to the realities of how quickly emissions can be reduced. Passing that target will probably lead to some irreversible changes, such as melted glaciers and species losses. To overshoot the mark by only a small amount, or not at all, requires reducing emissions by about 45 percent relative to 2010 levels by the year 2030. The planet would then be able to reach net zero, when the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere is balanced by the amount removed, by around 2050, the IPCC report notes. To bring warming back down below the 1.5 degree target by the end of the century, the world will need negative emissions technologies to remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Such technologies that limit or even reverse warming are less pie-in-the-sky than they sound, says Stephen Pacala, an ecologist at Princeton University. “Although there is a lot of doom and gloom available on the progress of humanity, there isn’t on the technological side.” Pacala chaired a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine committee that released a report in October that analyzed the viability of current and emerging negative emissions technologies as well as encouraged large-scale investments in them. Some simple negative emissions practices already in use include planting forests to soak up atmospheric carbon, or growing plants for biofuels and then storing underground the CO2 from the burning of those fuels. But current efforts have drawbacks. Planting sufficient forests or biofuel crops “would have a large land footprint,” says economist and IPCC coauthor Sabine Fuss of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin. And that could impact future food availability and biodiversity. Other negative emissions technologies in development could become game changers, Pacala says. Direct air capture, in which CO2 is removed directly from the atmosphere and converted into synthetic fuel, is a proven technology. But so far, the high cost of direct air capture remains a barrier to commercial-scale development. The National Academies report says that nations should subsidize start-ups to drive competition in this area — after all, that’s what worked for wind and solar power, Pacala notes. Other proposed negative emissions technologies, such as converting atmospheric CO2 into a stable mineral form (SN: 9/15/18, p. 9), show some promise but require large-scale financial investment in their basic science to make them viable, the report states. Reducing demand for resource-intensive products will also be important to reach the 1.5 degree target, Fuss says. Cities need to move away from fossil fuels, and individuals can do their part by, for example, traveling less (SN: 6/9/18, p. 5), eating less meat (SN: 7/7/18, p. 10) and installing more energy-efficient appliances. Data show that, given the right incentives, people are willing to make such lifestyle changes, says IPCC report coauthor Linda Steg, an environmental psychologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. And those incentives aren’t necessarily financial or based on self-interest, she adds. “People are also motivated by protecting the interests of others, or by the quality of the environment.” Holding warming to 1.5 degrees “is not impossible,” says Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University and an IPCC report coauthor. But “it really requires ambitious efforts, and the sooner the better. We have to start cutting emissions now.” Political will to act varies country by country, but scientists have done what they can to convey the urgency and the scope of the climate change problem, says IPCC report coauthor Heleen de Coninck, an environmental scientist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands. Nations “have it in their hands, and they know what they are working with,” de Coninck says. “Now it’s up to them.”"
"47","With nowhere to hide from rising seas, Boston prepares for a wetter future","Boston has armed itself with a science-driven master plan to protect itself from increasingly inevitable storm surges and rising seas.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boston-adapting-rising-sea-level-coastal-flooding","Boston dodged a disaster in 2012. After Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of New Jersey and New York, the superstorm hit Boston near low tide, causing minimal damage. If Sandy had arrived four hours earlier, many Bostonians would have been ankle to hip deep in seawater. Across the globe, sea levels are rising, delivering bigger storm surges and higher tides to coastal cities. In Boston, the most persistent reminder comes in the form of regular “nuisance” flooding — when seawater spills onto roads and sidewalks during high tides. Those nuisance events are harbingers of a wetter future, when extreme high tides are predicted to become a daily occurrence. “The East Coast has been riding a post-Sandy mentality of preparing and responding before the next big one,” says Robert Freudenberg, an environmental planner at the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy firm based in New York City. But a more enduring kind of threat looms. “Sea level rise is the flooding that doesn’t go away,” he says. “Not that far in the future, some of our most developed places may be permanently inundated.” And Boston, for one, is not waiting to get disastrously wet to act. In the seven years since Hurricane Sandy’s close call, the city-run Climate Ready Boston initiative has devised a comprehensive, science-driven master plan to protect infrastructure, property and people from the increasingly inevitable future of storm surges and rising seas. The famously feisty city intends to be ready for the next Sandy as well as the nuisance tides that promise to become the new normal, while other U.S. coastal cities are trying to keep up. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox British colonists founded Boston in 1630 next to a freshwater spring on the heavily forested Shawmut Peninsula. By the 1800s, the trees had been replaced by a bustling trading port. As the population grew, industrious residents began filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks, dirt and trash to create more buildable space. By the early 1900s, the city had tripled in geographic land area. The South End, Charlestown, East Boston, Back Bay and downtown neighborhoods, including attractions like historic Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium, are all built on landfill. Even Logan International Airport is built atop a filled-in tidal flat that was once five islands. Boston’s original coastline (green) includes the Shawmut Peninsula, where the city was founded in 1630. Much of the current city is built on landfill (brown), once marshlands and tidal flats. The Muriel G. and Norman B. Leventhal Family Foundation Of course, early Bostonians had no idea that rising seas would one day threaten former lowlands. With more filled-in land area than most major U.S. cities and 75 kilometers of shoreline, Boston is the fifth most vulnerable coastal city to flooding from sea level rise in the United States — after Miami, New York City, New Orleans and Tampa — and the eighth most vulnerable city in the world, in terms of overall cost of potential damage, according to the World Bank. When it comes to coastal flooding, Boston has a lot stacked against it. The city’s official elevation is 14 meters above sea level, but its lowest areas sit at sea level. Over the last century, sea level in Boston Harbor rose by about 28 centimeters, due to both thermal expansion of seawater as the oceans warm (SN Online: 9/28/18) and the melting of distant ice sheets. Conservative projections for Boston place sea level about 15 centimeters higher by 2030, 33 centimeters higher by 2050 and 149 centimeters higher by 2100. In a worst-case scenario, if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace, sea level could rise by as much as three meters by 2100. New England and the eastern shore of Canada have a unique combination of geographic factors that push water farther inland in response to high tides: The region’s shallow seafloor topography tends to funnel water higher inland, and its proximity to the Gulf Stream — a major ocean current that runs from the Gulf of Mexico up along the East Coast — also helps magnify tides. Due to rising ocean temperatures, the Gulf Stream is slowing down, causing even more water to pile up along the East Coast and boosting high tides, physical oceanographer Tal Ezer of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., reported in June in Earth’s Future. In 2017, Boston racked up a record 22 nuisance tides (defined in Boston as tides over 3.8 meters above average sea level), according to a 2018 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As sea level creeps higher, the Seaport and some other areas of Boston could see daily tidal flooding by mid-century, says Kirk Bosma, a coastal engineer with the Woods Hole Group in Massachusetts. As sea level rises, so does high tide. When storms hit at high tide, the combination of storm surge and high tide is a storm tide. In Boston Harbor, the highest recorded storm tide crested at 4.6 meters above sea level in January 2018, causing extensive flooding. Climate Council of Australia, adapted by T. Tibbitts Flooding during extreme high tides, when there’s no storm in sight, already happens in East Boston, Charlestown and the downtown waterfront (SN Online: 7/15/19). David Cash, an environmental policy expert at the University of Massachusetts Boston, has witnessed high tide flooding from his office overlooking Dorchester Bay and Morrissey Boulevard, a major thoroughfare and the primary road to the campus. “Morrissey Boulevard now floods several times a year at high tide on blue sky days,” Cash says. If a storm hits at high tide, its effects can be greatly magnified, creating a storm tide, Bosma says. Boston lies in the path of both winter nor’easters and Atlantic hurricanes, which are increasing in intensity, NOAA reported in July in an overview of current research on global warming and hurricanes. When storm surges and heavy rain or snow hit coastal cities with more concrete than absorptive marshland, the combination can overwhelm urban drainage systems and cause flooding. The winter of 2018 was stormy, even by New England standards. In January, winter storm Grayson dumped more than 40 centimeters of snow on Boston. Streets were flooded deep enough to float large dumpsters in the dark, icy water. “During the storm, the high tide came right up over the seawall, across the street and poured into my office building’s parking garage,” says Joel Carpenter, an equity trader at Congress Asset Management in the Seaport. As massive plow trucks drove through about a meter of seawater, pushing huge ice chunks out of the way, Carpenter wondered how he would get home. “Public transport was shut down.” He had to walk through ankle-deep water to a spot several blocks from his office, where an Uber was willing to pick him up. When the ocean surged 4.6 meters above the high tide mark, Grayson broke the record set in 1978 for the highest storm tide. Just two months later, in March, winter storm Riley delivered another record storm surge. Like it did in 2012, the city got lucky: Riley didn’t hit at high tide, Bosma says. “If Riley had occurred with hide tide, it would have been disastrous.” As it was, public transportation ground to a halt and the National Guard had to come in to help evacuate stranded motorists and residents. “These storm events are a real wake-up call,” Cash says. “Our future is going to be wet.” By the time those winter storms hit, Boston was already getting serious about protecting itself against flooding. In 2015, officials assembled BRAG, the Boston Research Advisory Group, to bring Boston-based researchers together to guide science-based decision-making for Climate Ready Boston. “BRAG is like a mini Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just for Boston,” says BRAG member Ellen Douglas, a hydrologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. BRAG combines peer-reviewed literature and locally sourced published data to project Boston-specific impacts of heat waves, storms and sea level rise. In 2016, BRAG released its first report, “Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Projections for Boston.” The references run long, citing more than 100 studies. Based on the probabilities of the various sea level rise scenarios outlined in the report, Boston is preparing for up to 100 centimeters of sea level rise. Future zoning and coastal resilience projects — those intended to protect people and keep property from flooding — will need to safeguard against at least 100 centimeters, about a yardstick’s worth, of sea level rise. “We did a full citywide vulnerability assessment [of] how, when and where the city would be affected over different time frames,” using BRAG’s sea level rise estimates, says Bud Ris, a senior member of the Green Ribbon Commission, a consortium of business, institutional and civic leaders that advises Climate Ready Boston. Several Boston neighborhoods and public institutions are on low-lying landfill (left). Climate Ready Boston is preparing the city for about 100 centimeters of sea level rise (right), which will flood several areas (dark blue) if no action is taken. Several Boston neighborhoods and public institutions are on low-lying landfill (top). Climate Ready Boston is preparing the city for about 100 centimeters of sea level rise (bottom), which will flood several areas (dark blue) if no action is taken. Boston is ranked eighth worldwide for expected economic losses due to coastal flooding, estimated at $237 million per year in 2005 and $741 million annually by 2050, according to a 2013 study in Nature Climate Change. “Those kind of numbers frame the upfront costs and the call to action pretty starkly,” Ris says. “If we don’t do the work now, we are going to pay even more later.” The cost of adaptation is daunting; estimates range into the billions of dollars over the next 50 years. In April, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh pledged 10 percent of the city’s $3.49 billion capital budget in 2020 to fund resiliency projects, such as raising major roadways and replacing existing concrete structures and pavement along coastlines with floodable green spaces. Though much more money will be needed, Massachusetts has a history of coming up with funds for staggeringly expensive public works projects, Ris says. Cleaning up the infamously filthy Boston Harbor cost taxpayers about $5 billion over two decades. The city spent $22 billion on the Big Dig, the country’s most expensive highway project that took two decades to reroute the city’s formerly elevated Central Artery into a tunnel system completed in 2007. “If we come up with a workable plan, the money will come from somewhere,” Ris predicts. One of the first steps toward building a more flood-resilient Boston was to map where the water will go, Douglas says. “The first set of maps we put out [in 2011] showed what the coastline of Boston will look like by the year 2100 with sea level rise and a large storm surge. The map got a lot of attention because it was so blue.” With 100 centimeters of sea level rise, much of Boston’s fill land will be inundated by the harbor, returning the remaining landmass to the original shape of the Shawmut Peninsula. Low-lying city landmarks such as North Station, Faneuil Hall and the aquarium would be permanently awash in blue. The Boston Harbor Flood Risk model, released in 2015, shows how flooding in and around Boston Harbor will change over time under various scenarios. “We looked at thousands of different [historical and simulated] storm events combined with sea level rise, waves and tides, and determined the movement of floodwaters out of the harbor and into the streets,” says Bosma, who led the modeling project. The model identified the financial district, Fort Point Channel and the Blackstone Block Historic District as among the city’s most vulnerable areas. “If you just look at the 2100 maps, [preparing for flooding] can seem pretty hopeless,” Bosma admits. “But the models show where we need to focus our money and efforts right now and where we can plan for future projects in 2030, 2050 and beyond.” The city government has also been working on making more detailed street-by-street maps of Boston’s many neighborhoods, says Carl Spector, Boston’s commissioner of the Environment Department. “We started with East Boston and Charlestown, because they are already seeing flooding,” he says. That report was released in 2017, followed by a report for South Boston in 2018. The city is now evaluating the downtown and North End districts. “These reports have priority lists and recommended timelines for when projects should be started and completed over the next 30 years,” Spector says. Protecting individual buildings from flooding usually involves waterproofing lower floors, raising electrical equipment and installing pumps to remove floodwater. But on a citywide scale, flood protection starts at the coastline. The most efficient way to prioritize resiliency projects is by focusing on efforts that can protect entire neighborhoods, rather than single buildings, Bosma says. “Boston is not flat; it actually has quite a bit of topography that directs water in certain ways. We look to the coast and try to come up with more regional solutions — whether that be a floodwall or a berm or a park — that can protect a whole slew of inland assets all at once.” So why not build a concrete seawall around Boston Harbor to protect the entire city? BRAG and the Sustainable Solutions Lab at the University of Massachusetts analyzed the feasibility of installing a pair of barriers across the harbor. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense from both financial and operational standpoints,” Bosma says. A permanent barrier would cost as much as $20 billion and require intensive maintenance. Plus it could limit the size and frequency of ships coming and going from the harbor as well as impede the flow of water needed to maintain water quality. Building a dynamic harbor barrier, with gates that open and close to allow for shipping and water flow, is feasible from an engineering standpoint, Bosma says. But by 2040 or 2050, sea level will probably be high enough that such gates would need to be closed for almost every high tide to prevent flooding. “The size and magnitude of the gates required would take six to eight hours to open or close,” he says. “They’d have to be almost constantly moving.” Shore-based solutions that buffer against high tides and storm surges make more sense, the analysis found. Nature-based coastal adaptations such as parks and wetlands that can absorb the flooding are not only effective but also bring added benefits such as native habitat restoration, tourism and recreational opportunities, according to a study conducted on the Gulf Coast and published in 2018 in PLOS ONE. “As much as possible, we’re using nature-based solutions that are flexible and can be adjusted over time to conditions depending on what happens with sea level rise,” Bosma says. Resilience is about more than keeping buildings dry. “We may be able to protect Boston’s buildings, but if people can’t turn on the lights and can’t flush the toilets and they can’t get to work via public transportation and they can’t call for help because the phones don’t work, we’re going to be in deep trouble,” says John Cleveland, executive director of the Green Ribbon Commission. Outages in the power grid, as well as telecommunications, water and gas services — which rely on the power grid — can cascade inland to places that never actually get wet, says Rae Zimmerman, an urban infrastructure planner at New York University. For convenience, fiber optics, gas mains, water mains and electric power distribution lines often share the same underground conduits. “It’s cheaper to install and maintain them that way, but it also means that when one system goes haywire, they all go,” Zimmerman says.  Climate Ready Boston is behind in this arena. “As far as I know, the city hasn’t started coordinating its strategy around its infrastructure for transportation, energy, water, wastewater and communications,” Bosma says. “We need to be embedding resilient design standards into ongoing infrastructure investments.” For example, when the city overhauled its stormwater and wastewater sewer systems 30 years ago, “we didn’t foresee the problem of sea level rise,” says John Sullivan, chief engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. During flood events, partially shared wastewater and stormwater drainage systems make keeping seawater out of Boston’s wastewater treatment plants a challenge. The city is now researching strategies for storing influxes of stormwater using existing natural depressions in the landscape and even parking garages, so that saltwater does not get into the wastewater treatment plants and wreak havoc on the microbes that help process the waste. One goal is to incorporate backup systems that flow with gravity and don’t require pumping. “If we can avoid having to pump, which requires electricity, we’ll be better off in the event of a power outage,” Sullivan says. Last summer, a team led by computer scientist Paul Barford of the University of Wisconsin–Madison released a series of maps that overlapped the physical internet — fiber-optic cables, hubs and data centers — with projections of sea level rise in major U.S. coastal cities. Just like with the water systems, nobody was thinking seriously about sea level rise when the infrastructure that runs with the internet was installed 20 years ago, Barford says. “Now we have thousands of miles of cables and major data centers that are susceptible to damage during coastal flooding events.” Waterproofing vulnerable components of the physical internet may help, but the most critical infrastructure may need to be moved inland away from the coasts, he says. Pipes, conduits and power lines follow existing roadways, so some utilities may be able to piggyback on the maps and strategies developed for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Douglas says.  Boston is fifth among the U.S. cities most at risk for coastal flooding, but when it comes to preparation, how do other coastal centers stack up?  “MassDOT has taken all of our reports very seriously,” she says. “They have a lot of infrastructure in the way of sea level rise.” Perhaps the biggest challenge is to keep the Big Dig highways open for traffic while protecting the tunnels from flooding, Douglas says. “You can’t just close off the tunnels. They are important evacuation routes during emergencies, but they were not built to tolerate any amount of flooding.” Not so long ago, sea level rise was considered a distant problem, something to deal with a hundred years or more from now. But sea level rise is already lapping at U.S. shores. Boston may be among the oldest cities in the country, but it also might prove to be one of the most resilient. The Climate Ready Boston plan is well under way, with completed district-level projects in East Boston, Charlestown and South Boston. Work includes installing a deployable floodwall along the East Boston Greenway, elevating a section of Main Street in Charlestown to protect a large swath of the neighborhood and removing concrete to restore floodable parks and green space in South Boston and the Seaport. With momentum building in Boston, the resiliency project is expanding to the rest of the state; Massachusetts has over 300 kilometers of coastline to protect, including the curled arm of Cape Cod. This spring, Massachusetts Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo and Governor Charlie Baker each pledged $1 billion in grants for resilient infrastructure and climate adaptation projects across the state. When it comes to implementing climate adaptation strategies, other cities, including New York, can learn from Boston, says Freudenberg, the environmental planner in New York. “Developing a vision for climate adaptation is easy. Implementing that vision is much harder,” he says. “At some point, once we’ve considered the science and all the available strategies, we have to start building. It’s been seven years since Sandy and seas are rising. It’s time to take action.”"

Record-breaking temperatures and strong winds are fueling an unprecedented number of wildfires across the region this summer. In Siberia alone, hundreds of wildfires captured by satellite images July 28 spanned about 3 million hectares of land. Across Alaska, as many as 400 wildfires were burning as of mid-July. And the heat is also melting Greenland’s ice at an alarming rate. The scale and intensity of the June 2019 wildfires are unparalleled in the 16 years that the European Union’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, or CAMS, has been tracking global wildfire data. And July’s numbers “have been of similar proportions,” says CAMS senior scientist Mark Parrington. “I’ve been surprised at the duration of the fires in the Arctic Circle, in particular.” Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Wildfires most often occur in the Arctic in July and August, sparked by lightning strikes. But this year, unusually hot and dry conditions in the Northern Hemisphere in June exacerbated the problem and drove the fire season’s start earlier, the World Meteorological Organization reported July 12. Unusually high temperatures and low precipitation in the region were almost certainly fueling the July wildfires as well, Parrington says. In early August, CAMS will release its monthly bulletin summarizing the July data, he adds, and “I wouldn’t be surprised if the July fires correspond to [those climate] anomalies.” In Alaska, a heat record toppled July 4, with temperatures reaching as high as 32.2° Celsius (90° Fahrenheit). Average June temperatures in parts of Siberia were almost 10 degrees higher than the average temperatures from 1981 to 2010. That same month, more than 100 intense wildfires were burning within the Arctic Circle. On August 1, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite took this image of western Greenland. To the left of the island’s ice sheet, an active wildfire burns. Meanwhile, abundant melt ponds (appearing as blue spots) collect on the ice itself, another effect of record temperatures.    Greenland is also sweltering in the Northern Hemisphere’s heat wave: The island lost nearly 200 billion tons of ice in July, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute. On July 31, a record-breaking 56.5 percent of Greenland’s ice sheet was showing signs of melting, DMI glaciologist Ruth Mottram told the Associated Press. Images from the Copernicus satellite captured August 1 show multiple melt ponds, as well as burn scars from a recent fire and smoke from an active fire on the island. The Arctic blazes are not only scorching vast swaths of Earth; they’re also releasing copious amounts of carbon dioxide. June’s fires alone released more than 50 metric megatons of carbon dioxide, the WMO said, more than the total released by all June fires from 2010 to 2018. Total CO2 emissions from the Arctic wildfires for July are estimated at about 79 megatons, Parrington says. That’s roughly double the emissions from the previous record-setting month: July 2004. That year also set a previous annual record, with total Arctic wildfire CO2 emissions of about 110 megatons. 2019 has already smashed that record. About 79 metric megatons of carbon dioxide were emitted by wildfires in the Arctic Circle in July 2019, smashing the previous record set in July 2004. Carbon dioxide emissions from wildfires in the Arctic in July, 2003–2019 Emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are responsible for the current era of global warming (SN: 8/3/19, p. 7). Human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases have already warmed the planet by 1 degree C above preindustrial times. Temperatures in the Arctic are increasing twice as fast as the global average, further promoting the growth and persistence of wildfires in the region. Such Arctic wildfires are expected to become more common as the planet warms. There’s geologic precedent for that: Layers of black charcoal in sediments in the Canadian Arctic suggest that wildfires frequently raged across the region during the Pliocene Epoch, when global atmospheric CO2 levels were between 350 and 450 parts per million — similar to today  (SN: 12/9/17, p. 24). In June, CO2 levels averaged 413.92 ppm, according to data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Meanwhile, increasingly frequent winter warm spells, insect outbreaks and wildfires have also caused many Arctic plants to lose their resistance to freezing, dry out and die, turning large parts of the Arctic brown (SN: 4/13/19, p. 16). That, in turn, increases the region’s susceptibility to more wildfires: Normally, the icy peatlands are soggy enough to be fire-resistant, but they are thawing and drying out. Once set ablaze, the carbon-rich peat can burn for months, releasing large amounts of CO2 back into the atmosphere and fueling the warming feedback loop (SN: 3/17/18, p. 20)."

"50","A mysterious coral disease is ravaging Caribbean reefs","Scientists are racing to learn what’s behind a disease that’s “annihilating” whole coral species in hopes of stopping it.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-coral-disease-ravaging-caribbean-reefs","Divers monitoring coral reefs off St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands in January noticed something alarming: Big white lesions were eating into the colorful tissues of hundreds of stony corals. Some corals were dead by the next day — only their stark white skeletons remained. Others languished for up to two weeks. Within four months, more than half of the reef suffered the same demise. What’s killing the corals is far from clear, but the prime suspect is stony coral tissue loss disease, sometimes referred to by its initials SCTLD or by the nickname “skittle-D.” This infection, discovered off Florida in 2014, is responsible for what some scientists consider one of the deadliest coral disease outbreaks on record. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox In the Caribbean, the disease is now ravaging about a third of the region’s 65 reef-building species, scientists estimate. Yet researchers aren’t even sure if the disease is viral, bacterial or some other microbial mix. Whatever the cause, “it’s annihilating whole species,” says coral ecologist Marilyn Brandt, who is leading a science team trying to tackle the outbreak from multiple research angles. Past outbreaks of other coral diseases near St. Thomas have cut coral cover by up to 50 percent over a year, says Brandt, of the University of the Virgin Islands. But this new disease has done the same amount of damage in half that time — spreading faster and killing more corals than any past outbreaks in the area. “It marches along the reef and rarely leaves corals behind,” Brandt says. “We’re pretty scared.” Stony coral tissue loss disease can kill corals in a matter of days or weeks. Here, a lesion eats away at coral tissue over six weeks. Coral reefs occupy less than 2 percent of the ocean floor. But they play a crucial role in the ecosystem, sustaining an estimated quarter of marine species. Sometimes mistaken for rocks or plants, corals are actually collectives of coral polyps, tiny invertebrates that get sick just like any other animal. Corals sometimes succumb to deadly plagues. Other times, they can shake off milder maladies akin to a common cold.   Since the first coral disease was documented in the 1970s in the Caribbean, researchers have identified dozens more around the world, with the Caribbean now considered a coral disease hot spot. But scientists still know little about these illnesses and how they work. Many marine microbes don’t grow well in petri dishes and test tubes, so studying coral diseases is tough, Brandt says. Even the names given to the diseases are vague, based only on the visual cues of an infection, such as yellow-band disease, dark-spot syndrome and white plague. And it doesn’t help that many look similar.  Stony coral tissue loss disease, which first attacks brain corals before moving on to other stony corals, was initially mistaken for white plague. Off southeast Florida, the outbreak has persisted for five years. In that time, the disease has affected almost all of a 580-kilometer stretch of reef, including the Florida Keys, says marine biologist Karen Neely of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Such a prolonged assault surprised scientists. Coral disease outbreaks typically burn out after a few months. Stony coral tissue loss disease appeared off Florida in 2014 and has since spread across the Caribbean. Cases of the disease have been confirmed (red) on reefs off Mexico, Jamaica, St. Maarten, the Dominican Republic and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Suspected cases are shown in orange. Mapping cases of stony coral tissue loss disease Source: P.R. Kramer, L. Roth and J. Lang/AGRRA 2019 (Data source: AGRRA) Neely and others are trying to save Florida’s reef-building corals by moving hundreds of healthy colonies to tanks, where they can be studied, bred and protected from the outbreak along the coast. Meanwhile, divers slather sick corals left in the reef with a disinfectant and an amoxicillin paste, which seems to heal lesions. Neely estimates that Florida researchers have treated nearly 1,200 colonies since January. With the antibiotic, “we are seeing about 85 percent success,” Neely says. But the medicine doesn’t stop new lesions from popping up. “One of the big priorities is to develop colony level treatments,” she says. Until then, this paste “is the best we can hope for.”   The antibiotic’s effectiveness suggests the disease could be bacterial, Brandt says. But the disease could have viral origins, in which case the paste would be treating a symptom, not the cause. To find out what might be causing the disease, members of Brandt’s team are looking at corals’ microbiomes — the multitudes of microbes that live in and around corals. Building the list of suspects requires first sorting out what normally belongs on healthy corals, and what doesn’t. At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, marine ecologist Amy Apprill and colleagues are scrutinizing the microbiomes of sick corals, as well as sediments and water circulating around the reefs in St. Thomas. Comparing that data with data from Florida corals may uncover similarities between the two outbreaks that can help narrow the list of culprits, Apprill says. The team is also focusing its microscopes on samples of brain and star corals taken just as lesions popped up. Originally from a healthy reef in St. Thomas, the corals caught the disease during an experiment in which they were placed near infected corals from Flat Cay in an aquarium. “We might be getting a look at what ‘early’ disease looks like,” Apprill says, before opportunistic microbes gain a foothold. She doesn’t expect to find a singular pathogen, though. “Many scientists are moving toward this idea that it may be a consortium” of microbes that causes a disease, she says. And that consortium could look different for different coral species and in different environments. But a disease might trigger similar shifts in microbial diversity, so those patterns are something to watch for, Apprill says. New clues about stony coral tissue loss disease are coming from a research team in Florida led by Julie Meyer of the University of Florida in Gainesville. That team found that diseased corals had microbiomes that were more prone to change and become more diverse than their healthy counterparts. Genetic analyses of these microbiomes identified five types of bacteria abundant in corals infected with the disease, the researchers report May 3 at bioRxiv.org. At least one type thrives in low-oxygen conditions that accompany decaying tissue, and all have been linked to other coral disease outbreaks around the world. But more work is needed to determine if the microbes identified are causing the disease, or simply taking advantage of an opportunity to populate the weakened coral. While some researchers hunt for pathogen suspects, coral immunologist Laura Mydlarz and others are investigating what happens to sickened corals at the cellular level. “I’m more on the host side,” trying to figure out why some hard coral species are more vulnerable than others, says Mydlarz, who is part of Brandt’s team. Mydlarz’s lab, at the University of Texas at Arlington, has shown that the immune systems of some susceptible coral species get stuck in cell-death mode, or apoptosis, when tricked into thinking that pathogenic bacteria are invading. These corals slough off their tissue. Species that are more disease-tolerant, however, had immune systems that went into cell-recycling mode and fought off infection, her team reported in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2017. Mydlarz suspects something similar might be happening in corals vulnerable to stony coral tissue loss disease. That’s because the species in her study that favored cell-death mode are among those hit hardest by the outbreak.   This race to learn more about stony coral tissue loss disease and other infections is becoming urgent as climate change warms ocean waters. Global warming is like a one-two punch for coral disease: Heat stress and bleaching may weaken coral defenses, while warming waters send pathogens into overdrive. Pollution, overfishing and other environmental factors can also stress corals, giving pathogens an in. “Coral reefs just can’t catch a break,” Brandt says. “I feel like we’re playing whack-a-mole,” addressing one challenge after another. Oceans are now warming 40 percent faster than what had been predicted in the 2014 report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, according to an analysis published in January in Science. And the trend is expected to continue, as oceans soak up roughly 93 percent of excess atmospheric heat trapped by greenhouse gases. As ocean temperatures rise, coral disease will likely rival bleaching as a major driver of coral decline. Disease outbreaks are expected to become more frequent and more severe, researchers reported in 2015 in Nature Climate Change. Flat Cay reef off St. Thomas had been considered resilient, having rebounded from a major bleaching event in 2005 and back-to-back hurricanes in 2017. But the current outbreak has killed off all of the reef’s maze corals, a type of brain coral. And pillar corals could be next, Brandt says. Stony coral tissue loss disease “seems to be capable of changing the face of coral reefs as we know it.” The researchers are trying to keep up with where and how the disease is spreading. Pathogens may have made their way from Florida to St. Thomas in the ballast water of ships, says coral reef ecologist Dan Holstein of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Stony coral tissue loss disease has also been reported on reefs off the east coast of Mexico, Jamaica, St. Maarten and the Dominican Republic. Holstein is using ocean current data and other factors to forecast where the disease might show up next. Early results suggest that another U.S. Caribbean territory, Puerto Rico, should be worried. Divers in May confirmed that the outbreak is inching toward the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, with star corals about 17 kilometers offshore and 40 meters deep already pocked with white lesions, says Tyler Smith, who oversees the reef monitoring program at the University of the Virgin Islands in St. Thomas. The discovery was disheartening, Smith says. Scientists knew that star corals in shallower waters were susceptible to the disease, but hoped those living in deeper waters might be spared (SN Online: 7/19/18). He likens the deep reefs, made up of hundreds of millions of densely packed colonies, to a powder keg. With deeper star corals also succumbing, “the spread of [the disease] might pick up very rapidly,” Smith says, “even more than it is now.”   Brandt and colleagues are continuing to monitor reefs in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In June, they found a glimmer of hope in waters near St. Croix. None of the 270 sites surveyed around the island showed signs of the disease, though some corals did have the less-severe white plague. “It was a moment of panic,” Brandt says. “Everybody is on high alert.”"
"51","A new dengue vaccine shows promise — at least for now","The latest vaccine against dengue shows promise in protecting children from the disease, but will need longer term study to ensure kids are safe from future infections.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dengue-vaccine-shows-promise-at-least-for-now","The latest dengue vaccine reduced
the occurrence of the disease by about 80 percent in children vaccinated
compared with unvaccinated children, researchers report. But the full picture
of the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness is still under study, and won’t
emerge for several more years.  Dengue is responsible for an
estimated 390 million infections each year. There’s no cure for the viral
disease, which can cause fever, aches, pain and — in severe cases — bleeding, vomiting and rapid loss of blood pressure,
which can be fatal. Young children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to
developing severe disease. The new vaccine, under development by Takeda Vaccines, is called TAK-003. Among 12,700 children ages 4 to 16 who were given two doses of TAK-003 three months apart, 61 infections occurred, compared with 149 cases among 6,316 children not given the vaccine. TAK-003 also reduced the occurrence of dengue cases that lead to hospitalization by 95 percent: Of the 210 cases of dengue, there were five hospitalizations among the vaccinated children compared with 53 in the unvaccinated ones, researchers report online November 6 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results describe how the vaccine performed in the year after the second dose; the children, from Asia and Latin America, will continue to be followed another 3½ years.  Dengue, one of the world’s
most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne diseases, is gaining footholds in new areas thanks to global
travel, urbanization and climate change (SN:
10/7/19). Along with measures to control mosquito populations, developing a
vaccine is seen as key to fighting dengue, says Derek Wallace, a physician who
heads the dengue vaccine development program at Takeda Vaccines in Cambridge,
Mass.   Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox But creating a vaccine
against dengue is challenging. There are four different, but closely related, dengue
viruses, labeled by number. A person infected by dengue type 1, for example, develops
antibodies to that type. But those antibodies can conspire to make a second infection with a different dengue
virus severe (SN: 11/8/17).  This phenomenon, called antibody-dependent enhancement, “plagues vaccine development,” says Scott Halstead, a virologist who has spent his career studying dengue and first described this enhancement in the 1960s. If a vaccine doesn’t produce a strong and long-lasting immune response to all four of the viruses, it could mean a later infection not only isn’t protected against, but is actually made worse. That’s what happened with the
first widely used vaccine candidate, Dengvaxia, developed by the pharmaceutical
company Sanofi Pasteur, based in Lyon, France. In a 2015 study, researchers
reported the vaccine reduced the occurrence of dengue by around 60 percent in
vaccinated children. But in 2017, the company announced the vaccine shouldn’t
be used in children who hadn’t been previously exposed to dengue. A huge
vaccination campaign in the Philippines was halted,
and reports surfaced of some children becoming very ill after vaccination (SN: 5/21/19).  “The vaccine was acting as a
silent first infection in those kids who hadn’t been exposed in the past,” says
infectious disease epidemiologist Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer of the University
of California San Francisco School of Medicine, who was not involved in the
development of either vaccine. After reanalyzing the data from the Dengvaxia
clinical trials, scientists reported that the vaccine protected kids who
already had been exposed to dengue, but increased the risk of severe infections in kids who
hadn’t been, according to a study
published July 2018 in the New England
Journal of Medicine.  Going forward, it will take a lot of
transparency from vaccine manufacturers and questioning from the scientific
community “to make sure that the same thing doesn’t happen again,” Rodriguez-Barraquer
says. “I do hope eventually there will be a dengue vaccine that will be
accepted,” she says. “It would help a lot of people.” The new vaccine by Takeda uses a
weakened version of dengue type 2 virus as its backbone with bits of the other
dengue viruses added to it. By comparison, the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine was made
with a yellow fever virus that incorporated pieces of each of the dengue
viruses.  Takeda tested whether children in its
study had been exposed to dengue before vaccination. Initial results didn’t
find a large difference between the groups: The vaccine reduced the occurrence
of disease by close to 75 percent in those not previously infected with dengue,
and by 82 percent in those who had been. But the extent of the vaccine’s
protection won’t be clear until the longer term results are available."

really go the distance to find food, a mate or a place to raise their young.
And now, thanks to scientists’ tracking efforts, we know just how far some land
species will travel. Using decades of scientific observations, researchers determined round-trip migration distances for a number of animals. Caribou have the longest migrations, with two different herds in Alaska and Canada traveling up to 1,350 kilometers per year, the team reports October 25 in Scientific Reports. That’s a little less than the distance from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore.  Gray wolves (Canis lupus) aren’t usually migratory, but a
Canadian group thought to follow caribou is the only other tracked species that migrated over 1,000
kilometers in a year, the scientists found.
 In the contiguous United States, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have the longest annual land migrations, traveling up to 772 kilometers in Wyoming and Idaho. Other animals performing annual long-haul migrations — each around 600 to 700 kilometers round trip — include the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) in the Serengeti of Africa, and the Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) and Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) in Asia.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in Wyoming and Montana migrate about 300 kilometers, while pronghorns in Canada travel some 435 kilometers per year. The researchers calculated the migration distances by measuring a straight line between the two migratory end points, and then doubling that for a round-trip figure. While the distances are impressive, they are still far short of the thousands of kilometers traveled each year by migrating insects (SN: 4/5/18) or birds (SN: 2/7/17), which can be less encumbered by infrastructure.    “For land
animals, something as small as a road could be a barrier,” says Claire Teitelbaum,
an ecologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who was not involved in
this study. “A fence or wall certainly would be.”  Infrastructure,
including roads and cities, already has hampered some animals’ land migrations,
scientists say. And climate
change could be having an effect by altering environments and the availability
of foods, Teitelbaum says. Previous research had found that a herd of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Canada, for
example, migrated up to 1,500 kilometers annually in the early 2000s when the
herd had more members, instead of the current maximum of 1,350 kilometers. But it’s
not clear exactly what caused that journey to be shortened.  Some caribou in Alaska and Canada have the longest annual migration route of any land animal, in part because these herds have lots of room to roam, a study finds. Gray wolves aren’t usually migratory, but a Canadian group thought to follow caribou is the only other tracked species that migrated over 1,000 kilometers in a year. Source: K. Joly et al/Scientific Reports 2019 Only 7
percent of unbroken land patches worldwide are larger than 100 square
kilometers, leading some scientists to predict shorter land migrations to come.
“We will see migration distances declining, rather than increasing, into the
future,” says Marlee Tucker, an ecologist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands,
who wasn’t involved with the work. “These [natural] areas are shrinking.”  Understanding
where animals roam could help scientists and policy makers prioritize which
areas to preserve. That information could also help them decide where to establish
wildlife corridors — long strips of natural land or
tunnels beneath roads that connect animal habitats. Most animals with the longest migrations were in Alaska or Canada, where there are large swathes of wild terrain. “The north is much less developed than the lower 48 [states], so there’s much more room for those migrations,” says coauthor Kyle Joly, a National Park Service wildlife biologist based at the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in northern Alaska. Because temperatures can change drastically in the region, and vegetation in some places is scarce, “these animals need to roam over greater distances,” Joly says.  The researchers also
determined the total cumulative distance traveled in a year for the animals in
the study using GPS data. While the team expected that the large, hooved
animals would cover long distances, the data on cumulative distances revealed a
surprising find, Joly says. Predators covered more total ground than their
prey.  The most well-traveled
animal was a gray wolf in Mongolia that covered 7,247 kilometers in one year
while being tracked from 2003 to 2005. Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and Mongolian wild asses, also called khulans (Equus hemionus hemionus), also surpassed
5,000 kilometers in a year. In Alaska and Canada, gray
wolves racked up more distance than the caribou they hunted. The same held true
for gray wolves stalking khulans in Mongolia, as well as brown bears (Ursus arctos) hunting Alaskan moose (Alces alces gigas). “The total scope of the movements is important to let people know what the scale of the conservation … measures need to be,” Joly says. "

equine encephalitis since U.S. health officials began
monitoring the mosquito-borne disease
15 years ago is prompting aerial bug spraying and dire warnings to avoid the
biting insects well into fall. As of October 1, 31 cases — including nine
deaths — have been reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.  Known as EEE or Triple-E for
short, the incurable brain infection is still relatively rare — there have been only 103 reported infections in the
United States in the past decade. Only five percent of people bitten by an
infected mosquito will develop the disease. But about a third of EEE patients die, and many who survive experience permanent
neurological problems.  Science
News spoke with several researchers about how the
virus spreads, and possible factors that might be contributing to the recent
surge in cases.  “We don’t know some of the
basic details about these [mosquito-transmitted] diseases, unfortunately,” says
pathobiologist Stephen Higgs, director of the Biosecurity Research Institute at
Kansas State University in Manhattan. “The ideal is to anticipate outbreaks,
which is very, very difficult. But we need to be prepared for an outbreak when
it comes.” Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The virus that causes eastern
equine encephalitis is initially carried by Culiseta
melanura mosquitoes, which feed on blood from birds (SN: 4/9/19) and rarely bite
humans. However, other mosquito species, including Aedes mosquitoes, can
pick the virus up from infected birds and then spread the virus to humans and
other mammals, including horses — which is how EEE originally got its name.  When an infected mosquito
bites a person, the insect spits a solution of substances that help prevent
blood from clotting, making it easier to suck blood. “That’s why you might have
that little red bump —
because it’s spitting into you,” Higgs says. “If there are viruses in those
salivary glands as it’s spitting, it will also spit virus into you.” About 30 percent of the 103 eastern equine encephalitis cases recorded in the last decade have occurred in 2019. On average, there are about seven human cases of EEE in the United States each year. Infected patients may first
experience a fever, headache, chills or muscle and bone pain. If the virus moves
to the central nervous system, it can cause encephalitis, or swelling of the
brain. With no cure for EEE, doctors can only treat the symptoms and help to
boost a patient’s immune response to the infection.  The northeastern United States has been most affected by
the disease, along with states along
U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Great Lakes region. These states tend to have humid
forests and swampy areas where mosquitoes like to breed.  Of the 31 cases confirmed as of October 1, 12 have been in Massachusetts, nine in Michigan, three in New Jersey, three in Rhode Island, two in Connecticut, one in North Carolina and one in Tennessee, according to CDC spokeswoman Maggie Silver. At least nine people have died, according to the CDC’s Oct. 1 tally. “We’ve got cases in states which have really not typically had human cases,” including Tennessee, Higgs says. And Connecticut, with two new cases, had only seen one other case, in 2013. Virus also has been detected in 2019 in mosquitoes in several states — including Maine, New York and Louisiana  —  that have not had human cases this year. The eastern equine encephalitis virus has infected humans in 22 U.S. states, mostly around the Gulf Coast, in the Great Lakes region and along the Atlantic coast. In 2019, Tennessee became the 22nd state to record a case.  Researchers aren’t sure, but
suggest a combination of factors could be to blame. Also unclear is whether the
current disease surge is an anomaly, or if the country might see higher numbers
of cases in future years as well.  “With any mosquito-borne
disease, it’s cyclical,” says Silver. The number of cases rises in summer, when
mosquito populations swell, and declines as temperatures drop and frost kills
off the adult insects.  Conditions that encourage mosquitoes to proliferate can increase the disease risk, such as warmer
temperatures (SN: 3/13/12). “One of
the reasons we’re seeing outbreak cycles more frequently is probably related to
the fact that the mosquito breeding season is longer now,” says Catherine
Brown, state epidemiologist with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in
Boston. That’s cause for concern, given that climate change is pushing average temperatures up across the globe (SN:
7/1/19).  Rainfall can also have an
effect. Because mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, small pockets of
undisturbed water are crucial for breeding. And lots of rain means more such breeding grounds, which could “set up
the stage for us to have very large mosquito populations,” Brown says.  The best way to prevent a
Triple-E infection is to avoid being bitten by a mosquito in the first place. The CDC recommends using insect
repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants and keeping doors and windows
closed. People also can make sure there is no standing water around their
homes, and avoid other breeding areas such as swamps at dawn and dusk, when
mosquitoes are most active. Some counties in affected states including Massachusetts have begun spraying against mosquitoes. “Aerial spraying is a way to cover large geographic areas in a relatively efficient way,” Brown says. But it can’t eliminate the EEE infection risk or get rid of all mosquitoes. “It’s not a magic bullet.” "
"55","The largest seaweed bloom ever detected spanned the Atlantic in 2018","Nutrient-rich water from the Amazon River may be helping massive seaweed mats to flourish each summer in the Atlantic Ocean.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/largest-seaweed-bloom-ever-detected-atlantic-ocean-2018","During the summer, vast, floating islands of Sargassum algae can blanket entire parts of the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The algae reached their largest extent on record in June 2018, forming a giant brown belt that extended for 8,850 kilometers from the west coast of Africa into the Gulf of Mexico. At least 20 million metric tons of Sargassum made up the belt, the largest bloom of seaweed ever detected, researchers say. Satellite data tracking the extent of the mats over the last 19 years reveal a sudden, dramatic increase in the summer of 2011, and recurring almost every year since, the scientists report in the July 5 Science. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox These annual massive mats of seaweed, which the researchers have dubbed the great Atlantic Sargassum belt, have been fueled in part by increasing nutrients pouring into the ocean from the Amazon River, the study suggests. Forests can both filter and regulate the flow of water from land to ocean. But with increasing fertilizer use and deforestation anticipated in the coming decades along the Amazon’s tributaries, such colossal blooms may become a new normal. The floating algae islands have long provided an important shelter for turtles, fish, crabs, eels and other marine species (SN Online: 4/13/17). But there can be too much of a good thing, particularly when Sargassum mats crowd coastlines. They can smother corals and seagrass, and wreak havoc on coasts across the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico as heavy, meters-thick layers of the seaweed wash up on beaches and rot (SN Online: 8/28/15). To track the waxing and waning of the Sargassum, the researchers, led by optical oceanographer Mengqiu Wang of the University of South Florida in Tampa, used data from satellite instruments that scan the ocean in visible and infrared light wavelengths. Sargassum algae, like photosynthesizing plants, contain abundant chlorophyll-a. That pigment pings brightly at infrared wavelengths, creating a sharp and easily detectable contrast to the darker water beneath. From 2000 to 2010, there was little of the algae in the central Atlantic, with the occasional patch near the mouth of the Amazon River in the summer and fall. But a tipping point occurred in 2011, when the line of seaweed suddenly and dramatically extended all the way across the ocean, the team found. That change in 2011 “was really surprising,” says James Gower, an optical oceanographer at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in North Saanich, British Columbia, who coauthored a commentary in the same issue of Science. “It really stood out in the satellite data.” Each year since, except 2013, the algae have formed a similar, vast belt. In 2018, that belt was the largest and densest yet, the team reports, containing at least 20 million metric tons of algae — about four times the weight of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Since 2011, satellites have detected a wide swath of Sargassum algae, dubbed the great Atlantic Sargassum belt, extending from the west coast of Africa to the Gulf of Mexico each July (monthly mean density, shown). The year 2013 is the one exception, when above-average sea-surface temperatures may have suppressed the seaweed’s growth. The largest extent on record occurred in 2018.  Sargassum algae growth in the Atlantic Ocean in July, 2011–2018 USF College of Marine Science Two sources of nutrients appear to be feeding the blooms: discharge from the Amazon River and upwelling along the coast of West Africa. Upwelling, in which surface waters are pushed aside by strong prevailing winds, allowing deeper, nutrient-rich waters to rise toward the surface, occurs there naturally, due to the interaction of winds, ocean and the rotation of the Earth. How those nutrients will change in the future is uncertain. There’s a lot that scientists still don’t know about the sources of those nutrients, as well as how climate change will affect the seaweed’s life cycle. Nutrients carried on dust blown into the ocean from the Sahara, as well as inputs from Africa’s Congo River, may also have a role. And, particularly warm sea-surface temperatures, such as occurred in 2013, appear to suppress the algae’s growth, the team notes. That casts some doubt on the fate of the blooms in a warming world. Having this global eye on the seaweed has been key to beginning to understand the sudden growth. Even higher-resolution satellite data collected over the world’s oceans could help researchers better track the movement of the algae and suss out what’s really causing the blooms, Gower says."

Climatologists are routinely questioned about what’s really causing global warming. Doctors can be disparaged for trying to vaccinate children against disease. But for the U.S. public at large, scientists are generally seen as a trustworthy bunch. In fact, 86 percent of Americans hold at least “a fair amount” of confidence that scientists work for the public good,  according to a survey released August 2 by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox That’s far better than how respondents felt about what motivates politicians (only 35 percent said they were fairly confident that elected officials acted in the public interest), journalists (47 percent) or even religious leaders (57 percent). And that general trust in the goodwill of scientists has grown steadily over the last four years, from 76 percent in 2016. But confidence falters on narrower questions of scientists’ trustworthiness. For instance: “The issue of trust in scientists is part of a broader conversation that society is having on the role and value of experts,” says Cary Funk, the director of Pew’s science and society research. “What we wanted to do was get a look at the potential sources of mistrust.” Conducted from January 7 to January 21, the survey questioned 4,464 randomly selected adults who are demographically representative of the U.S. population, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. It focused on three scientific fields: medicine, nutrition and environment. But it did not look at specific topics that have become highly politicized, for example, childhood vaccination campaigns (SN: 6/8/19, p. 16) or climate change (SN Online: 7/28/17). When it comes to overall confidence that professionals act in the public good, scientists scored the highest among respondents, followed closely by the military. Trust in the motivations of journalists and politicians trailed, by comparison.  T. Tibbitts Source: Pew Research Center Survey 2019 The growing trust in scientists is “really great to see,” says Jacob Carter, a research scientist for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. But the fact that so few people had faith in scientific transparency and accountability was “a bit disheartening to me as a scientist,” he says. There are systems in place to prevent scientific misconduct and penalties “if, for example, you’re caught plagiarizing or fabricating results,” he says. The introduction in March of congressional legislation called the Scientific Integrity Act marks a positive step toward building public trust in science, Carter says. The bill aims to prevent political interference in scientific policy and to allow government scientists to share research with the public, among other things. The survey also found that 60 percent of Americans believes scientists deserve a place in debates over crafting science policy — though that result reveals a partisan divide. Among Democrats, 73 percent wanted scientists at the table in policy discussions, but that fell to 43 percent among Republicans. Still, those numbers are encouraging, especially in a national survey covering all 50 U.S. states, says Max Boykoff, director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. “Empowering scientists to step into these [policy] arenas is great,” he says. “Certain kinds of advocacy, I would argue, are part of their responsibility: advocacy for facts, empirical evidence, solid methodologies.” Overall, scientists have been more willing to step into the public arena in recent years. Thousands of scientists and science advocates joined the first annual March for Science in 2017 in Washington, D.C. (SN Online: 4/22/17). Journalists have become more interested in covering science stories, and social media is carrying messages further across society. Boykoff noted that younger scientists especially have been open to speaking about their work, which has helped to make science more accessible to the public. And, in fact, the survey found that people overall were more trusting of research in areas that they were more familiar with. Two other key factors boosted confidence, too: whether research data was made publicly accessible and whether findings were reviewed by scientific peers. “Trust is important to legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness,” Boykoff says. “Without trust, scientists would just be screaming into the wind.”"

The finding, published February 7 in Nature, is based on a new statistical analysis showing that such a rapid collapse of marine ice cliffs in Antarctica was extremely unlikely to have happened in the past, even during some of Earth’s warmest episodes over the last 3 million years. The study, by climate scientist Tamsin Edwards of King’s College London and colleagues, counters a controversial hypothesis that suggests that rising greenhouse gas emissions could destabilize those cliffs and help send sea levels surging by over 2.1 meters by 2100. That figure is nearly double some sea level rise projections for the end of the century. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox How quickly human-caused global warming is causing the great ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica to melt into the sea is one of the most urgent questions related to future sea level rise. Some scientists fear that melting could speed up dramatically sometime in the future, thanks to a possible feedback loop known as marine ice-cliff instability, or MICI.  The hypothesis was described by geoscientist Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and paleoclimatologist David Pollard of Penn State in a 2016 study in Nature. Using computer simulations of the mechanical and structural properties of ice, the researchers suggested that ice cliffs at the edges of glaciers that jut into the sea are a dramatically underestimated source of future sea level rise (SN: 4/30/16, p. 13). “Ice that flows into the ocean essentially always ends in a cliff,” DeConto says. “Basic physics tells us that very tall cliffs, extending 100 meters or more above the water surface, will begin to produce stresses in the ice that can exceed its strength.” When that happens, the ice breaks, or calves, and giant blocks of ice tumble into the sea. The collapse of such cliffs would then create new cliffs behind them that would tumble as well, in a kind of domino effect. One reason the MICI hypothesis was controversial is that there are a lot of uncertainties about the progression and effects of such cliff collapse, Edward says. Would all the blocks end up in the sea? How much surface melting of the ice would there be, and how would that meltwater help speed the fractures along? “We would all agree that ice cliffs might have a maximum height and above that they’re unstable, that the strength of ice has a limit,” she says. But the question is how that translates to sea level rise. To figure out whether a MICI feedback might have actually happened in Earth’s past, Edwards and her colleagues ran a statistical analysis of the original MICI simulation. They wanted to determine the likelihood that sea level rise during warm episodes might have been linked to ice-cliff collapse in Antarctica. The researchers focused on the mid-Pliocene warm period that lasted from about 3.3 million to 3 million years ago, the last interglacial period 130,000 to 115,000 years ago, and the years from 1992 to 2017, which span the time for which satellite data of the rate of ice mass loss exist. The original computer simulations of ice-cliff collapse by DeConto and Pollard included only about 64 iterations. “We were limited by cost in how many simulations we can run,” says DeConto. Edwards’ team, however, mapped out statistically how the simulation would respond in 10,000 different iterations, by changing parameters from the estimated rate of atmospheric warming to estimated past sea level rise. The MICI hypothesis, the researchers found, wasn’t needed to reproduce any of the past sea level changes during those three time periods. DeConto says he’s happy that researchers are trying to test the ice-cliff instability theory. “I think we’ve shaken some trees,” he says. “The fact that folks are pushing back is a good thing.” And Edwards’ team’s study, he adds, highlighted the usefulness of statistically analyzing many possible outcomes for a computer simulation. Meanwhile, he, Pollard and other colleagues presented an updated computer simulation of how MICI might affect future sea level rise in December in Washington, D.C., at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting. Their newest findings support the Edwards’ team’s conclusion that marine ice-cliff instability won’t double sea levels by 2100 — but suggest that’s only because the ice-cliff instability hasn’t really kicked in yet. By 2200, they say, the picture is far less rosy: If greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current track, MICI could help bump up sea level up to as much as 4 meters higher than they were in 2000."

Trained forecasters use data, trends, human behavior and more to predict what lies ahead. Exactly no one at Science News is a quantitative forecaster or futurist. But we do hear what scientists are buzzing about at meetings, on social media and while reporting stories. So when we asked our writers to predict the big science stories of 2019, each person brought well-informed insights, with a dash of optimism (and sometimes pessimism), to the task. Here’s what they had to say. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox This first set feels a bit like cheating: Some already scheduled happenings will no doubt lead to big findings. The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, starts its third observing run in February. With upgrades, LIGO may detect many more black hole mergers than it saw in past runs, astronomy writer Lisa Grossman says. And our moon will get a lot of traffic in 2019, she adds. China expects to land the first sample-return mission on the moon since 1976 (SN: 11/24/18, p. 14). India will head to the moon’s south pole. And the Israeli company SpaceIL will send its own spacecraft. Grossman and physics writer Emily Conover also put their money on 2019 as the year we finally get a glimpse of a black hole – if the Event Horizon Telescope captures Sagittarius A* , the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Our prediction that the telescope would capture that prize as early as 2017 was a tad premature. Meanwhile, the Parker Solar Probe, which launched in August, will fly close to the sun in April and in September to yield never-before-seen details about our star (SN: 7/21/18, p. 12). In 2019, the Parker Solar Probe will make two of its planned 24 orbits of the sun.  Bruce Bower, who covers behavioral sciences and human evolution, went meta with his main prediction. “Scientific focus will intensify on what it means to be human, and how evolution produced us,” he says. When did the current set of human characteristics emerge? How about the mental capacity of modern people? Did interbreeding with other Homo species play a role? “Anthropologists, archaeologists and geneticists will all weigh in,” Bower says. Our brains are one thing that makes us human, and neuroscience writer Laura Sanders predicts that in 2019, scientists will finally figure out the purpose of the claustrum. This paper-thin sheet covers the insular cortex, a brain structure involved in emotional processing. The claustrum was once theorized to be the seat of human consciousness. “This is one of the most mysterious parts of the human brain,” Sanders says. The 2017-2018 flu season was harsh, causing 80,000 U.S. deaths and sending some 900,000 people to the hospital (SN Online: 9/27/18). Biomedical writer Aimee Cunningham wonders if 2019 will be the year for a universal flu vaccine (SN: 10/28/17, p. 18). She also predicts we’ll see ramped up production of cell-based vaccines, which are reportedly 20 percent more effective than widely used vaccines grown in chicken eggs.   We’ve started a handful of stories with “ultracold superconductors are heating up.” We’ll be saying it again in 2019, Conover says. She reported in September that lanthanum-hydrogen compounds under pressure showed signs of superconductivity — transmitting electricity without resistance — at 215 kelvins (-58° Celsius) to 280 kelvins (about 7° C), the warmest temperatures yet for superconductivity (SN: 10/13/18, p. 6). If those results hold up, the compounds will set the record for the highest temperature superconductor. Conover will also be watching how work unfolds on layered graphene, which may show a type of superconductivity seen in other materials that scientists still can’t explain, she says (SN: 3/31/18, p. 13). On to our gloomy predictions. Technology writer Maria Temming expects there will be more accidents involving self-driving cars in 2019 — because there will be more self-driving cars on the road from companies such as Waymo and General Motors (SN Online: 3/19/18). New safety standards may not require driverless vehicles to have steering wheels, mirrors or pedals. A hands-off setup would make it difficult — or impossible — for a person to take control if something goes wrong.   Regulatory agencies will keep busy in 2019. Staff writer Laurel Hamers has her eye on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, chemicals used in nonstick coatings and firefighting foams that have become persistent contaminants of U.S. water sources (SN: 11/24/18, p. 18). “It’s a topic area to watch, both research-wise and regulations-wise,” Hamers says. Regulatory groups have their eye on the gene-editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 as well. In 2018, the European Union set stringent rules on gene-edited crops. Will other countries follow? And what will be the fallout of the explosive announcement that gene-edited babies were born in China? Molecular biology writer Tina Hesman Saey wants to know. Climate change will continue to be a big story. As earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling noted in our top story of 2018 (SN: 12/22/18 & 1/5/29, p. 18), the last year has brought studies connecting climate change to extreme events such as Hurricane Florence and Asia’s 2016 heat wave. These climate attribution studies will become more common, she predicts. To slow climate change and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels will require technology that can remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the air. “I’m predicting that research on this will kick into high gear,” Gramling says. “Or maybe I’m just hoping.”"

Researchers are now fretting about what the waste from these debris-eating midges may do to the continent’s once nutrient-sparse moss banks. The midge Eretmoptera murphyi, a kind of tiny fly that can’t actually fly, hitchhiked onto the Antarctic island of Signy probably sometime in the 1960s during plant-introduction experiments that would never be allowed today. In moss banks where the alien midges now thrive, their excretions boost nitrogen concentrations to levels similar to those where seals come ashore, says Jesamine Bartlett, a polar and alpine ecologist at the University of Birmingham in England. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox She has calculated that the hard-to-spot midges triple or quadruple the usual nitrogen in moss banks, which seals don’t visit. Bartlett, who also works with the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, reported the results December 19 in Birmingham at the annual meeting of the British Ecological Society. The midges are a shock to the ecosystem because Antarctica doesn’t have the usual earthworms and other voracious detritus-feeders that quickly break down dead plants and other organic debris, like the midges do. So the insect “has the potential to change the way the ecosystem functions quite drastically,” says systems ecologist Peter Convey, also of the British Antarctic Survey, who collaborates with Bartlett. Extra nutrients could, for instance, offer opportunities to more invaders. Conveniently for the invaders, these midges are an all-female species. “You only need one lady to be dropped off” for a population to get a foothold, Bartlett says. If conditions are turning harsh, a female can lay her big, jellylike glob containing 40 to 50 eggs even before fully emerging from her own pupal stage to adulthood.   The eggs she lays typically need about two years to reach motherhood themselves. Eggs hatch in about a month into the first of four larval stages with a soft wormy body, often yellow from its nutrient stores of lipids, a hard head capsule and eye pits for rudimentary visual tasks. When larvae eventually graduate to the final pupal stage and grow an adult body, the high-priority gonads form early. In a late stage, the pupae in their protective cases take on a crusty look “as if they’ve been tempura fried,” Bartlett says. Legs come free of the pupal case before full adulthood, allowing a pupa to crawl around. “I found it quite alarming the first time I saw it,” she says. If the mere specks of larvae hitchhike unnoticed on boots and establish themselves in other parts of Antarctica, there could be “serious repercussions,” says ecologist and invasion biologist Melodie McGeoch of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who isn’t part of the midge study. Warming due to climate change may create new homes for midges in Antarctica, making the invasion even more of a cause for concern. Ice-free patches could expand by more than 17,000 square kilometers by 2100, close to a 25 percent increase, a 2017 study in Nature predicted. That estimate does use a pessimistic warming scenario, says Jasmine Lee of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, one of the authors on the study in Nature. However, she adds, it’s “the one the globe is currently tracking.”"

U.S. pediatricians are tackling the problem.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-words-acts-el-paso-shooting-harm-children-health-longterm","Just days before 22 people were killed in El Paso, Texas, allegedly by an anti-immigrant gunman, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that racism was harming children’s overall health. Among the people fleeing the shooting at a Walmart on August 3 were young families with children shopping for back-to-school supplies. “Two young parents who sacrificed themselves to shield their 2-month-old infant … were within the age group of young people I serve,” says pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist Maria Trent of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who sees patients up to age 25. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The shooting, she says, highlighted two key risks to children’s health and well-being in the United States: gun violence and racism. “Older children and adolescents around the country hear the news, listen to adults talking and see this on their social media feeds,” says Trent, who coauthored the Academy’s new policy statement. “They need grown-ups to be able to assure them that they are safe — and to know that it’s actually the truth.” The stress of being targeted by, or even just witnessing, racist words and actions can take a lifelong toll on children and adolescents, the Academy warned on July 29 in a statement that marked the end of a decade-long deliberation on the issue. “The evidence to support the continued negative impact of racism on health and well-being … is clear,” Trent and her colleagues write. This is the first time the Academy has explicitly focused on racism. Trent spoke with Science News about the statement, and how pediatricians can respond. Her answers have been edited for length and clarity. SN: How does racism affect children and adolescents? Trent: Racism is harmful to a child’s health starting from the time that they are born. It affects their development, their mental health, their physical health in profound ways. [For] African American women in the United States, one’s lifetime experience of perceived racism is associated with the birth weight of their children. It can lead to poor maternal health that impacts their pregnancy, can lead to preterm labor and then can also lead to low birth weight in their infants. In adolescence, in order for young people to thrive, they have to have a healthy sense of who they are, and that includes ethnic identity. [In] young adulthood, we see the cardiovascular, metabolic and mental health outcomes [for] individuals who report experiencing racist events over their lifetime. People who witness those sorts of terrible acts … it could be a kid on the playground who watches a kid consistently called a derogatory name … when [bystanders] are asked as young adults to recall those events, they have the kind of response physiologically similar to first responders in a humanitarian crisis, like an earthquake. SN: What does racism do to a young person’s body? Trent: If you have an experience that is stressful, you can see a fight-or-flight response (SN: 3/7/15, p. 18). The problem with racism is that, oftentimes, people experience that over and over again, so they never have a chance to recover. They always have to be vigilant about their environments. Children can be exposed to racism in their everyday interactions with people, [and in] how they interact with the institutions that they depend on, like their health care environment or their school. Fear and stress, particularly if it’s prolonged, leads to toxic stress. People exposed to that serious early stress are at risk for heart disease, diabetes and depressive symptoms. SN: What can pediatricians do to help? Trent: We recommend that pediatricians self-assess, understand what our biases are and [be] able to manage them. We have to figure out what to do in our practices to make sure that we are delivering culturally and linguistically appropriate services to our patients. We have to train our staff [and] set expectations for how we will treat every patient that walks through the door. The community expects us to be leaders around child health. One of the people at our own practice at Hopkins [has] talked about how police engage young people and why adolescents are different (SN: 8/3/19, p. 4). It’s not about why kids of color are different … it’s about why adolescents are different. The officers began to realize [that the reason] young people responded to them the way they did was mostly the phase of development that they’re in. SN: What are some ways you’ve addressed racism in your practice?  Trent: Tattoos are common in adolescence now, and I find that in our community they tell stories. When I’m examining someone [I say], “So tell me about these, what do these mean?” They often tell trauma stories, evidence of loss. The thing I love the most is the opportunity to just listen to young people, and then help them mobilize the resources around them that they need in order to move forward. The biggest thing is to just listen. What [is] the outcome that young people want for themselves? [We] talk about the things they can and can’t control and about how they can manage themselves in those scenarios. SN: What does the Academy’s policy mean for medicine? Trent: This policy is not in response to any current event, but to the activities in our country over time. Racism is a socially transmitted disease. We pass it on to our children. We’re hoping that grown-ups, not just pediatricians, think about how their perspective, their speech, their behavior affects their children. Unequal access [to resources] is a part of the reason we see the kinds of scenarios we see. Every child should have a safe neighborhood to live in. Every child should have housing in a lead-free environment, that’s free of violence. Every child should have clean water. Young people should not have to be in places where they don’t have access to a bed or a shower or healthy food, or incarcerated just because they’re seeking safe spaces in the United States. SN: What can be done more immediately in the wake of the El Paso shooting? Trent: As pediatricians, we will be there to help families with these discussions and both the direct and indirect trauma that these events have caused. We will also continue our advocacy efforts to encourage our government leaders to adopt policies that broadly address gun violence and change the climate of racism impacting children, adolescents and families."

Previous research has suggested that the plateau reached its current height — about 4.5 kilometers above sea level, on average — by at least 40 million years ago. But chemical evidence left in the region’s rocks suggest that couldn’t have happened before about 40 million years ago, researchers report in the March 1 Science. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Meanwhile, another team of researchers suggests that, as recently as 25 million years ago, the region wasn’t yet a flat, windswept plateau. Instead, it was a diverse landscape of steep mountains surrounding a deep valley where palm trees grew, the team reports online March 6 in Science Advances. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau altered atmospheric patterns in the region, causing the onset of monsoons in South Asia as well as the drying out of Asia’s interior, says Svetlana Botsyun, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany. In fact, the plateau is so tall that it also affects the atmosphere around the globe, altering temperature, precipitation, humidity and cloud cover, Botsyun says. Yet when exactly that all began to happen isn’t clear. About 55 million years ago, the Indian subcontinent rammed northward into the Asia plate, and the land between them buckled. The Himalaya mountain range was born, and the Tibetan Plateau north of the mountains was pushed upward. Previous techniques to estimate changes in the region’s elevation over time have given varying answers on how long this took. One, called paleoaltimetry, uses oxygen isotopes, forms of the element with the same number of protons but different masses. At higher elevations, the ratio of oxygen-16 to oxygen-18 in rainfall is higher than it is at lower elevations. Previous analyses of the ratio of those isotopes preserved in the minerals of carbonate rocks, along with the dates of those rocks, have suggested the plateau must have been more than 4 kilometers high by at least 40 million years ago. Another way to figure out the timeline is to use plant fossils from species with a limited range of temperature or altitude tolerance. That fossil evidence has tended to suggest the plateau was much lower 40 million years ago, Botsyun says. The discovery of this fossilized palm frond in what’s now the central Tibetan Plateau suggests the region was neither as high nor as flat 25 million years ago as it is today. Based on the palm’s likely cold tolerance, researchers suggest the tree grew in a deep, ancient valley that was no higher than 2.3 kilometers above sea level at the time; the uplift to a flat plateau must have happened sometime after that, the researchers say. T. Su et al/Science Advances 2019 In the new study, Botsyun and her colleagues called the previous paleoaltimetry estimates into question. Factors other than elevation can affect oxygen isotope ratios in rainfall, she notes. Changes in concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and different sources of the water that becomes the precipitation can affect those ratios, throwing a wrench in the works. Those factors were at play during the Eocene Epoch, about 56 million to 34 million years ago: The epoch was marked by much higher atmospheric CO2 than today; a wide, shallow sea covered parts of what is now central China; and the Indian subcontinent wasn’t quite where it is now. All of those things may have altered the hydrologic cycle, and consequently the oxygen isotope ratios in the rain. Botsyun and her team took these factors into account in a series of computer simulations to re-create atmospheric circulation during the Eocene, and then recalculated the oxygen isotope ratios. “We can’t tell when the uplift [did] happen,” Botsyun says, but her team’s results suggested that, by 40 million years ago, the plateau was still no higher than 3 kilometers above sea level.  That the uplift happened later than once thought gels not only with past fossil evidence, but also with the new discovery of fossils of a kind of palm tree found in the central Tibetan Plateau. Paleobotanist Tao Su of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Mengla and colleagues date the palm fossils to about 25 million years ago. Based on the ability of the plant’s living relatives — all tropical and subtropical species — to tolerate cold, the researchers concluded that, at the time, the region could not have been more than about 2.3 kilometers above sea level. Su and colleagues also suggested that the region wasn’t a high, flat plateau at the time, either. Instead, the palm lived in a deep valley surrounded by high mountain ranges to the north and south, the team suggests. Their findings are based on computer simulations of past climate that varied the topography of the region and incorporated previous estimates of temperature based on leaf fossils at nearby sites. What we think of as the Tibetan Plateau was actually a jigsaw of tectonic blocks of land, each with its own elevation history, notes Robert Spicer, a coauthor on the palm fossil study. That history began around 200 million years ago, during a previous tectonic collision with the Asian plate. By the time the Indian subcontinent began its collision, parts of what is now the plateau were already as high as 4.5 kilometers above sea level, says Spicer, an earth scientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England. The valley in which the palm lived existed from about 60 million to at least 20 million years ago, Spicer says, and contains many more fossil finds “much older than the palms.” Those fossils suggest the valley floor was home to a fascinating, diverse subtropical ecosystem. But as the collision of the Indian plate with Asia continued, the land continued to rise, and sediment eroded from the mountain ranges eventually filled in the valley, forming a high flat plateau, he says. The plant and isotope-derived elevations agree on a key point: that the central part of what’s now the Tibetan Plateau rose to its current height much later than once thought, Spicer says. But to really understand the history of the Tibetan Plateau, the paleoaltimetry method needs to incorporate the geologic history of the region, he adds. “You need to get the topography right. If you have the wrong Tibetan geometry, you cannot produce realistic results.” Botsyun doesn’t disagree. “Based on our current research, we were able to reconcile existing paleoaltimetry data and paleobotanic evidence,” she says. But adding in a deep valley landscape to her simulations “would be really interesting.”"

"75","As waters rise, coastal megacities like Mumbai face catastrophe","For coastal megacities like Mumbai, rising seas and weather chaos linked with climate change threaten economic and social disaster.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-rise-coastal-megacities-mumbai-face-catastrophe","Each year when the monsoon rain sheets down and the tides swell over coastal Mumbai, Saif shutters his soda shop on Juhu Beach and takes shelter up in the rafters. Still, the water invades through the roof and over the concrete floors, sometimes reaching as high as the freezers full of ice cream. For 36-year-old Saif, the coastal megacity’s chronic flooding is stressful. “What would happen if too much water comes?” asks Saif, who, like many in India, goes by one name. “I could get swept up with it.” Last year’s torrential floods killed at least 14 people in Mumbai. And in July 2005, when a meter of rain fell in a single day, flooding cost the city about $1.7 billion in damages. Rebuilding his uninsured shop after the 2005 floods cost Saif about $57,000. He was lucky. When those floodwaters receded after two days, more than 1,000 people had died from drowning, landslides or other flood-related accidents in Mumbai and surrounding areas. “What can we do?” Saif asks. “Who can win against nature?” Such questions are becoming more urgent in coastal cities at mounting risk of climate-driven flooding. Climate change is raising sea levels, while also making storms more severe and bringing heavier rains to some places. For densely populated cities like Mumbai — the financial heart of India, which is the world’s fastest-growing major economy — those risks threaten to throw personal incomes and national economies into chaos. “The challenge is getting people to prepare for a risk they can’t yet see,” says Stéphane Hallegatte, lead economist at the World Bank’s Global Facility or Disaster Reduction and Recovery in Washington, D.C. “A very tiny change in sea level can have an enormous impact on risk levels,” he adds. By 2005, coastal city flooding cost the world an average of $6 billion a year, according to calculations by Hallegatte and colleagues. Even if humankind manages to limit the release of carbon dioxide enough to keep global warming to an average 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — which is highly unlikely — seas will still rise by a global average of about 20 centimeters by 2050, if not more. That’s enough to more than double the frequency of flooding in the tropics, where Mumbai is located, according to a 2017 paper in Scientific Reports. Global losses from coastal flooding may surpass $1 trillion annually by 2050 unless coastal cities prepare, Hallegatte’s team says. That projection is actually conservative, because it doesn’t include damage from other climate-related flood risks such as heavier rains and stronger storms (SN: 6/27/15, p. 9). Last year, Hurricane Harvey’s extreme rainfall, probably fueled by climate change, caused $125 billion in flood losses in Houston (SN: 1/20/18, p. 6). And in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Hurricane Maria caused $90 billion in damages, mostly from winds. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox If cities invest enough to just hold steady at their current level of flood risk, future losses would drop drastically, to about $60 billion per year, Hallegatte says. Mumbai’s share would be about $6.4 billion — making it the second-most economically vulnerable city after China’s Guangzhou. Many of Asia’s fast-growing coastal megacities, with populations of 10 million or more, are vulnerable to multiple flood threats. Mumbai, the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka and Manila in the Philippines, among others, face a future of heavier rainfall and higher storm surges. Manila and others, like Indonesia’s Jakarta, are also sinking fast. Some spots in Jakarta are sinking at a rate of 20 to 28 centimeters a year. “For an individual, it doesn’t matter if the water is coming from sea rise or a storm surge or the clouds, a flood is a flood,” Hallegatte says. “Cities should be looking … at one-meter sea level rise, at least. Because the cost of failure is so big, you need to have a plan for the worst-case scenario.” Mumbai and other fast-growing coastal megacities in Asia are particularly vulnerable to climate-related flooding. Twenty-one of the world’s 31 megacities hug a coastline, 13 of which are in Asia. These cities of 10 million or more often drive their national economies and are home to both rich and poor. As the world’s population balloons, two more Asian coastal cities will be pushed into the mega zone by 2030: Bangkok and Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City, according to United Nations estimates. In addition to flooding, these megalopolises could face water supply disruptions, dangerous heat waves (SN: 4/14/18, p. 18), increased food insecurity and more disease outbreaks. On a Sunday evening in June, the promenade along Mumbai’s iconic Marine Drive is packed. Families stroll eating ice cream, children chase street vendors peddling cotton candy, and friends squeeze together for selfies framed against the blue-gray waters of the Arabian Sea. Dark, roiling monsoon clouds loom over the horizon, as waves crash a meter away against the concrete barricade. The promenade was built a century ago when India was part of the colonial British Empire. The walkway’s days may be numbered. Mumbai’s coastal waters rose at least nine centimeters during the 20th century, according to tide gauge data. Today, seawater regularly spills over the promenade during high tide. It’s not clear how much farther seas will rise around Mumbai. A variety of factors, including tides, gravity and Earth’s rotation, influence local area sea rise in complex ways. And a lack of detailed data on Mumbai’s coastal geography available to scientists leaves questions on how future local water levels will affect specific areas of the city. The state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, acknowledged this data deficit in its 2014 climate change plan. Nevertheless, the state has so far ignored a 2017 Indian Supreme Court order to release maps demarcating future flood lines. Maharashtra’s environment secretary, Anil Diggikar, told Science News that the mapping is being done, though he did not say when the maps might be made public. But the state does recommend that rainfall and sea level trends be considered in new construction projects and public infrastructure. “This is especially important for [the] economic hub of Mumbai and surrounding districts,” he says, while also touting plans for restoring coastal stands of protective mangrove trees. Marine scientist Mani Murali of the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa, India, has tried to work out Mumbai’s future flood risk using low-resolution 2011 topographic data from NASA. That work, under peer review, doesn’t tell the detailed story he knows the city needs. “But I thought something is better than nothing.” He may have a point, with the rate of global sea rise fast accelerating — from a yearly average of 1.8 millimeters in the last century to about 3.0 millimeters per year today, according to a report in the Feb. 27 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Global sea level rise could be kept to a lower projection range (blue) if humankind curbs greenhouse gas emissions. Today, the world is on track for a much higher level of rise (tan).  C. Chang Source: IPCC 2014 And while global sea level projections up to 2050 are considered reliable, the situation beyond midcentury is less clear. Much depends on whether humankind can limit global emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping atmospheric gases. Princeton University climatologist Michael Oppenheimer is not optimistic. “This is a battle that we are currently losing,” says Oppenheimer, a coordinating lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report on oceans, cryosphere and climate change, due out in September 2019. “Sea level rise and the flood heights are only going to increase …for the foreseeable future.” The annual monsoon, the seasonal shift in winds that brings flooding rains to Mumbai, adds an extra layer of uncertainty to projecting how much flooding will accompany sea rise, he says. The future of this South Asian weather system has been difficult to predict, thanks in part to the mysterious influence of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. It’s Earth’s largest region of warm surface seawaters spanning the midocean region between the western Pacific and the eastern Indian oceans. That warmth partly fuels monsoon storm clouds. Still, most studies suggest that the monsoon rains will increase. “Uncertainty is not an excuse [for inaction] at this point,” Oppenheimer says. “People need to get moving.” Lakshmi Murali lives with her husband and son in a quiet, gated community, lush with jackfruit trees and flowering hibiscus in Mumbai’s flood-prone neighborhood of Andheri. Every June, as the rain starts falling, she unplugs the electronics in their ground floor apartment and moves her silk saris out from under the bed. Across the city, the rains rage against the glass windows of luxury high-rises. Public transportation and street commerce come to a halt. Water pounds the tin roofs of slum shanties where about half of Mumbai’s 21.4 million people live. A sewage-tainted slurry burbles out of the city’s outdated and often-clogged drainage system, backing up into rivers and creeks that then overflow into homes and businesses. Last year was particularly bad: In 24 hours, about 33 centimeters of rain fell. “You had to see it to believe it,” says Murali, a 54-year-old lawyer who is not related to the marine researcher of the same name. Her building’s plumbing system failed, and the toilets overflowed. Residents turned off their power for fear of getting electrocuted. As water rose inside their homes, Murali and a few neighbors used an iron rod to smash a hole through the wall surrounding their backyard to let the water flow out. “Today, we are young, and we say, ‘Yeah, it’s OK,’ ” Murali says. Even as such flooding worsens, she has what some might call misplaced faith that things will work out. “The state will work on building enough infrastructure to keep the city alive and will not allow the city to drown. Man will work against what nature is proposing to do.” Mumbai’s current predicament is partly due to the power of engineering over nature. Large parts of the city are built on land that, 300 years ago, was mostly underwater. When the Portuguese settled the region in the 16th century, they maintained Mumbai as a sleepy collection of coastal islands. But the British, who took over in 1661, reimagined Mumbai as a contiguous landmass and created a peninsula by filling in land gaps to connect the islands even in the wet season. Much of Mumbai is built atop landfill (black) that connects several islands (green) in the middle of Bombay Harbor. Those passages once allowed water to flow through the system at high tide and during monsoon rains.  Source: T. Riding/J. Hist. Geography 2018 “So many of these megacities are built on land that is only artificially higher than sea level, in places where landfilling took place,” says Washington D.C.–based Susmita Dasgupta, the lead environmental economist for the World Bank’s Development Research Group. Dasgupta was involved in the World Bank’s first report in 2007 on how sea level rise might affect national economies. The aim was to trigger discussion and preparation for a possible future economic catastrophe. She and her team offered guarded impact estimates based on hypothetical scenarios of between one and five meters of global sea level rise, using satellite images of coastal outlines and local elevations. In estimating potential economic losses, the team considered an affected area’s population multiplied by the country’s gross domestic product per capita, but not infrastructure or property assets. That report projected that one meter of sea rise would cost the world 1.3 percent of the global economy. Applied to the forecast global GDP for 2018, that comes to about $1.3 trillion, not far from the estimates by Hallegatte’s team. “But we wanted to raise the issue,” Dasgupta says. She faced a wave of hostility and derision for the effort. “Even bank colleagues were unhappy about it, saying we were being alarmist and that this kind of research was premature.” Eleven years later, no one doubts the sea is rising. Amid the confusing tumble of scientific studies on how climate change might raise flood risks, some scientists have built online visual apps to help the public understand what’s at stake. One tool, by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows past global sea level trends based on tide gauges. But the app does not give projections. And it relies on sometimes patchy data. For example, there are no readings for Mumbai’s water levels from 1994 to 2005 or after 2010. The Maharashtra government says local sea levels are rising 1.2 millimeters a year, based on those incomplete data. In 2017, a team from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, launched an app to demonstrate how melting ice sheets would affect 293 major port cities across the globe. The scientists measured the melt using NASA’s GRACE satellites, which detect gravity changes from the ice loss. To boost accuracy, the team recently added a component to the app that accounts for the fact that water expands as it warms. Still, true sea level rise projections involve complex computer modeling of overlapping systems. The JPL app doesn’t do that. “So it’s risky” to put too much stock in the numbers it spits out, says JPL sea level and ice supervisor Eric Larour. “But the real risk is that people underestimate that this is going to get worse.” For Mumbai, the JPL app foresees at least another 2.9-centimeter rise in coastal water in 10 years — and 14.4 centimeters in the next 50 years. Those estimates could soon be revised upward. Larour’s team plans one more update to include research published in the June 13 Nature showing that Antarctic ice sheets are melting three times as fast as they were 25 years ago (SN: 6/7/18, p. 6). That much melting, Larour says, is “a big, big deal.” The JPL team hopes to have a single, detailed modeling app for the world within two years, using NASA’s high-resolution satellite images of water levels and of land gradients, “so that people can use it in active mitigation policy,” Larour says. “A lot of areas at risk in South Asia — India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka — and across Asia don’t have the information to do this.” It’s not easy to find a coastal megacity taking decisive and effective action against future flood risks. Bangladesh has long built coastal sea walls of stacked mud, which may help prevent ocean storm surges from cascading inland to Dhaka. Fast-sinking Jakarta is working on its own giant sea wall as well. But walls won’t help Mumbai; they would prevent rain-driven freshwater floods from draining out after the monsoon. Massive structural engineering is not the answer. Many scientists suggest that cities lighten their burden on the land by maintaining natural coastlines, protecting sand dunes and preserving forests or even growing more of them. At the least, cities should refrain from making development decisions that will make things worse, such as paving over water-absorbent soils or building on natural floodplains. Governments can also improve storm drains, offer voluntary relocation packages or even consider introducing ferries rather than trying to raise or maintain existing roads. “We need to evolve to a situation where we’re more congruent with nature, rather than fighting it,” says urban planning expert Amrita Daniere of the University of Toronto, codirector of the Urban Climate Resilience in South East Asia Partnership. The group is aiding flood-preparation efforts in so-called second-tier cities, each still home to millions of people. “It’s too difficult to influence policy and practice in a megacity,” she says. There are cities like Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, that may be just too vulnerable. Built atop an estuary feeding into the Gulf of Thailand, the city — also sinking — is on track to go mega by 2030. “It wouldn’t shock me if they had to move the capital in 20 years,” Daniere says. Cities that don’t own up to their vulnerability risk squandering economic gains made in the last few decades, economists say. Some cities could face a financial reckoning even before flooding worsens. The mere notion of increasing risk is enough to spook investors. “That could have a domino effect on other cities, with bigger consequences for the global financial system,” says Gregory Unruh, an expert in sustainable business strategy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Yet modeling economic consequences is daunting, he says. These trends “tend to be based more on perceptions, on understanding bubbles and behavioral economics.” Pressure is mounting for cities to disclose climate risks. Credit rating agencies including Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have begun including climate change impacts in their assessments. Last year, the Financial Stability Board of the Group of Twenty international forum urged insurers, banks and institutional investors to release climate-related financial risk disclosures. Still, “there’s not much happening,” says Richard Hewston, a climate change analyst at Verisk Maplecroft in Bath, England, which advises on the risks of doing business around the world. “Sea rise is a gradual threat,” even though it can worsen events like tropical cyclones, Hewston says. So it’s difficult for people to use sea level rise as a reason to spend billions of dollars on infrastructure to prevent disaster. Mumbai’s flood risk makes the city a “high risk” place for climate change vulnerability — the second-most worrying category after “extreme risk,” according to Verisk Maplecroft’s 2018 hazard index. Among the world’s 31 megacities, Mumbai ranks as the ninth riskiest, based on about 50 factors ranging from preparedness to exposure to climate shocks like heat waves, drought, hurricanes and flooding. Mumbai’s high population density, high poverty rates and poor sewage and drainage systems “heighten the risk posed by climate-related events like flooding,” the company says. Verisk Maplecroft suggests that Mumbai build better sewage and drainage capacity, halt building on landfill and restore coastal mangrove trees, which keep the land intact with their tangle of roots and act as a natural buffer against the Arabian Sea. There is little evidence that any of that, beyond mangrove restoration, is being done. Drainage system upgrades have been stalled for years. Limits on building on floodplains are routinely ignored. Mumbai-based environmental economist Archana Patankar worries that these are signs of official neglect. Mumbai “is an extremely important city in terms of the economic wealth it generates,” says Patankar. The city’s economy rivals that of some developed nations in Europe. Its stock exchange is valued at around $2.2 trillion — almost twice the entire GDP of Mexico or Australia. Its Hindi-language Bollywood entertainment industry generates billions of dollars in global revenues each year. Not enough work has been done to assess how the city’s economy will be impacted, she says. Read more about how the impact of global sea level rise varies regionally. Alfaproxima/iStockphoto Instead, Mumbai appears focused on further developing its fragile coastline. The government is barreling ahead with plans for a 29-kilometer coastal highway, which will require ripping out patches of protective mangrove trees. Construction cranes punctuate the shoreline as new high-rises go up every year. Property developers are aware of sea level rise, but they’re in the business to sell. “No developer in Mumbai does any kind of risk analysis on how sea level and climate change is going to factor into their risks,” says Rohitashwa Poddar, managing director of local developer Poddar Housing and Development. Though his company aims to build future-proof homes by placing them on stilts or surrounding them with water-absorbing gardens, few of Poddar’s customers ask about flood risk. “People should know if they’re buying property in high-risk areas,” adds Stalin Dayanand, director of Vanashakti, the local environmental group that argued in the Indian Supreme Court for the release of the state’s forecast maps showing “hazard lines” for where the coast might be located in 100 years. The state missed the Supreme Court’s April deadline. Meanwhile, authorities moved ahead with plans for a $409 million memorial statue of the 17th century Indian ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji to be built on landfill in the middle of Mumbai’s bay. If projections are even close to correct, that 200-meter-tall statue could be left towering over a city swamped within decades."

Beyond the wooden slats, an expanse of gently waving saw grass stretches to the horizon, where it meets an iron-gray sky. Hardwood tree islands — patches of higher, drier ground called hammocks — rise up from the prairie like surfacing swimmers. The rhythmic singing of cricket frogs is occasionally punctuated by the sharp call of an anhinga or a great egret. And through this ecosystem, a vast sheet of water flows slowly southward toward the ocean. The Everglades, nicknamed the river of grass, has endured its share of threats. Decades of human tinkering to make South Florida an oasis for residents and a profitable place for farmers and businesses has redirected water away from the wetlands. Runoff from agricultural fields bordering the national park causes perennial toxic algal blooms in Florida’s coastal estuaries. But now, the Everglades — home to alligators and crocodiles, deer, bobcats and the Florida panther, plus a dizzying array of more than 300 bird species — is facing a far more relentless foe: rising seas. South Florida is ground zero when it comes to sea level rise in the United States. By 2100, waters near Key West are projected to be as much as two meters above current mean sea level. Daily high tides are expected to flood many of Miami’s streets. The steady encroachment of saltwater is already changing the landscape, killing off saw grass and exposing the land to erosion. Against this looming threat, Everglades ecologists and hydrogeologists are racing to find ways to mitigate the damage before the land is reclaimed by the ocean, irrevocably lost. Sea level rise is a global problem, but coastal water management in South Florida faces some particular challenges, as a 2014 National Climate Assessment report noted. Growing urban centers need access to freshwater, flat topography encourages ponds of water to linger, and porous limestone aquifers are particularly vulnerable to encroaching saltwater. Storm surges occasionally drive seawater far inland, compounding the problem. “We can’t ignore it anymore,” says Shimelis Dessu, a hydrogeologist at Florida International University in Miami. When it comes to water management needs in South Florida, ecological conservation has tended to be low on the list, compared with human and agricultural needs, Dessu says. Now, sea level rise is forcing people to think differently. “The ocean is no longer an external thing,” he says. “It’s already in the house.” Florida’s tug-of-war over water has a long history. In the 1800s, settlers first began draining the land to make way for agriculture and communities. Water management in the state began in earnest in 1948, when the U.S. Congress authorized the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes. That project was meant to control flooding along the Kissimmee River and Lake Okeechobee, in the south-central part of the state. During the rainy months in summer and fall, the river and the broad, shallow lake often overflowed, flooding surrounding areas. The spillage would travel slowly southward across southern Florida in a broad sheet and eventually drain into Florida Bay, an open water body between the mainland and the Florida Keys. During the journey, some of the water would seep into the ground, replenishing the Biscayne Aquifer, a limestone layer that underlies much of the southeastern part of the state. But the recurrent flooding made the land uninhabitable and farming impossible. So with Congress’ 1948 authorization, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a complex system of levees, canals and reservoirs to control the floods and channel water away from farmlands south of Lake Okeechobee and from growing population centers. Three large “water conservation areas” were constructed to collect and store water during high rainfall events and release it in times of drought. The remaining wetlands — encompassing about half of their original area — were enclosed into two protected areas, Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve. Such an intensive overhaul of South Florida’s water cycle led, perhaps inevitably, to new problems. Reducing the amount of freshwater that naturally heads south into the Everglades proved destructive to the habitats of plants and animals. Wading bird populations, for example, shrank by 90 percent over the last century. Diverting the water away from its natural overland course also meant less water was available to replenish the Biscayne Aquifer, which provides drinking water to 3 million people. Agriculture is big business in Florida; the state’s exports total more than $4 billion each year. But fertilizer from the agricultural regions pollutes waterways feeding into Lake Okeechobee, causing algal blooms in the lake. Regulated discharges from the lake to control flooding shunt polluted water to the east, west and south, causing periodic algal blooms on the coasts and in Florida Bay. Hoping to undo some of the damage, Congress approved a 35-year, $10.5 billion project in 2000 to send more freshwater south into the river of grass. That project, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, or CERP, remains the largest hydrologic restoration project ever undertaken in the United States. CERP has shown signs of success. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which evaluates the progress of Everglades restoration every two years, reported in 2016 that freshwater flow through the Everglades has indeed increased since the project began. And in some areas, groundwater levels and vegetation are beginning to return to how they looked before the extensive water management began. But the academy’s 2016 report also pointed to a glaring problem. Researchers know a lot more about the effects of climate change now than they did in 2000. Without accounting for these effects, particularly rising sea levels, the restoration plan will not be able to meet its intended goals: restoring the wetlands and buffering inhabited areas against Florida’s intensely fluctuating hydrologic cycle. Water flow in the Everglades begins with the Kissimmee River and other rivers, which pour into Lake Okeechobee. Left to its natural course (left), the water periodically spilled over the lake’s banks and flowed southward in a broad, shallow sheet (dark blue). But decades of heavy management (center) have channeled the water away from the wetlands to make way for South Florida’s cities and agriculture. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (right) aims to restore some of the natural flow while still managing the water.  T. Tibbitts Source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District Over the last half-century, the freshwater-saltwater transition zone in the Everglades has moved inland by at least a kilometer, due both to rising sea levels and to the reduction of freshwater flow through the Everglades. Some scientists call this inland shift of saltwater the Anthropocene Marine Transgression, a nod to the fact that humans are ultimately responsible for the rising seas and freshwater management. In part, it’s a simple problem of water pressure. Freshwater flowing down off the land, or in belowground aquifers, pushes toward the sea. If that tap is slowed to a trickle and freshwater pressure is reduced, the seawater meets less resistance and can drive farther inland. It’s a problem many coastal communities around the world have faced when overdrawing from coastal aquifer wells: Removing too much freshwater at once allowed seawater to sneak in and poison the well. Add rising sea levels to the mix, and the low-lying Everglades face a double hit of saltwater intrusion above ground and below. Because it is underground, the saltwater intrusion zone is not visible on a map. “But you can see the legacy effect … above ground,” says wetland ecologist Stephen Davis of the Everglades Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Palmetto Bay, Fla. “The salinity periodically knocks back the plant community.” Hardest hit is the ubiquitous saw grass. Saw grass is hardy stuff; it is resistant to wildfires and thrives even in nutrient-poor soil. But saltwater is another matter. In 2000, a team of scientists surveyed the southernmost portion of the Everglades from the air. The researchers noted odd pockmarks dotting the land — bare patches where the saw grass had died. “Some of these landscapes look like Swiss cheese,” Davis says. Beneath the land surface, saltwater and freshwater struggle for dominance in the Everglades. Saltwater is gaining the upper hand, as sea levels rise and drive the brackish zone farther inland. The saltier water causes peat soil to collapse and saw grass to die, leaving a pockmark pattern of brackish pools of water in the wetlands. 1. Saw grass grows in the freshwater zone. Mangrove trees thrive in the coastal brackish water.  2. Rising sea levels or hurricane-driven waters push saltwater farther inland. Soil collapses and saw grass dies.  3. More soil collapses around the dead saw grass, leaving a pool of brackish water.  Thick, organic peat soil is the building block of many wetlands, including the Everglades, says Fred Sklar, director of the South Florida Water Management District’s Everglades division, based in West Palm Beach. But peat soil is fragile: Too little freshwater and it dries up. And worse, the combination of dwindling freshwater and increasing saltwater inundation is a one-two punch, “a kind of turbo boost, allowing the soil to break down,” Davis says. Chemical or biological changes within the peat soil — scientists aren’t sure exactly what — then trigger a sudden collapse. Soil elevation drops rapidly, exposing the roots of the saw grass, which eventually die. The bare patches of ground are the most visible scars of saltwater intrusion, but the extent of the damage is probably much greater than is visually apparent, Davis says. Storm surges from hurricanes such as 2017’s Irma, along with king tide events, the highest high tides of the year, can push saltwater several kilometers inland. As a result, many regions that look fine to the eye are destabilizing beneath the surface, on the verge of collapse, he says. Widespread peat collapse could be devastating to the Everglades on two fronts. Maintaining the elevation of the soil is a bulkhead against seawater intrusion; the collapsed areas become zones of open water. And peat-filled wetlands represent a vast carbon sink — a region where far more carbon dioxide is absorbed through photosynthesis than is released through respiration. Losing the soil effectively changes the region from a place that stores carbon to one that adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, fueling climate change. Researchers don’t yet know how quickly land is subsiding in the Everglades. But research suggests that even slightly salty waters could cause the soil to sink at a “potentially staggering” rate, Davis says, dramatically increasing how quickly rising seas will be able to reclaim land. Biologist Sean Charles of Florida International University infused plots of saw grass–bearing peat soil with brackish water (still much less salty than seawater). In just one year, soil elevation in the salty plots sank by almost three centimeters, while the soil in the freshwater plots held its elevation or increased slightly. There’s a second boardwalk at Pa-hay-okee, which gets its name from a Native American word for “grassy waters.” Unlike the visitors’ overlook, getting to this platform requires a short, gutsy slog across a few meters of open wetland, possibly under the watchful gaze of an alligator. That expanse is an intentional deterrent, says Benjamin Wilson, a wetland ecologist at Florida International University. This boardwalk isn’t meant for visitors; it’s for scientists, who built it as part of a long-term research study to try to understand what, exactly, causes peat soil collapse. About a 20-minute drive to the south, a sister field site near West Lake is hidden behind a forest screen of salt-tolerant mangroves, their roots entangled and exposed, their branches creaking eerily. The two sites sit on either side of the saltwater intrusion zone: Pa-hay-okee is still largely fresh, but West Lake is brackish. The first phase of the project, led by wetland ecologist Tiffany Troxler of Florida International University, was to figure out where the peat is most vulnerable to sea level rise, now and in the future, using existing well data, geologic maps and computer simulations of sea level rise. The second step — and the reason for studying the paired sites — examined how salinity changes might affect the peat soil and saw grass. “And then we should have a better idea of where saw grass is going to be, and where peat collapse may occur in the future,” Troxler says. Alongside the boardwalk, the team embedded a dozen Plexiglas tubes right into the marsh. The chambers, each about half a meter in diameter, are open at the bottom and top, but can be twisted open or closed to allow the water to flow freely through them, or to temporarily sequester the chambers from the rest of the wetland. Many factors can alter soil chemistry. Reduced freshwater flow can dry out the soil briefly, exposing it to oxygen. And seawater seeping up from the phosphorus-rich limestone aquifer below the wetlands brings in an extra supply of the nutrient, which is otherwise in short supply in the Everglades. Once a month for four years — during wet and dry seasons — team members visited the chambers at both sites, closing them and dosing them with cocktails composed of different amounts of saltwater and nutrients. “It was fun,” Wilson says cheerfully. Despite the muddy slog, team members chose not to wear full-body waders. “We’re lucky to be in South Florida, where the water never really gets cold.” Then, he pauses. “Well, it can get really miserable,” he acknowledges after a few seconds. Although they didn’t wear waders, the researchers covered up in long-sleeved shirts and pants, even in the summertime, and shielded their faces, despite the stifling heat. “Do you want 100 mosquitoes in your face, or do you want to be sitting in 95-degree humidity, not being able to breathe with these masks on?” he asks rhetorically. This sometimes grueling work yielded results, as the team tracked how different factors might affect the saw grass ecosystem and peat collapse. Specifically, the researchers assessed changes in how much carbon dioxide the soil released into the atmosphere as a result of added salt and phosphorus, and also tracked changes in saw grass root growth. A change in microbe activity was another possible culprit in soil collapse. So microbial biologist Shelby Servais of Florida International University examined whether the saltwater increased microbial growth, which could in turn speed breakdown of organic material. It didn’t happen. “What we found is that, in general, salt exposure suppresses activity of the microbial community.” Even saltwater inundation — by itself — may not be causing the soil breakdown, Wilson says. What really seemed to matter was how dry the soil was to begin with, before saltwater was added. When the soil was already wet, adding more salt had no effect on how much carbon dioxide the soil released to the atmosphere, the team found. But when the researchers added salt to dry soil, carbon dioxide spiked. The team also noticed that saw grass plants grew fewer roots. A third phase of the peat soil project is now getting underway. The researchers will precisely track where soil elevation has dropped, and by how much. The team will plunge a rod into the ground all the way to the bedrock and use pins attached to the rod to measure elevation changes over time. From that, Troxler says, “you can get an idea of whether [soil creation in] the wetlands is keeping up with sea level rise.”  What should planners do if, as some simulations suggest, sea level rise is already outpacing the efforts by state and federal authorities to restore freshwater flow through the Everglades? Dessu and colleagues took a close look at freshwater management efforts side by side with projections of sea level rise. “We have some control over the freshwater management. The other side, the sea level rise, we don’t have any control over,” he says. The researchers had about 16 years’ worth of data on changing ecology in the wetlands, including information about the transitions of freshwater saw grass to salt-tolerant mangroves, loss of tree islands and proliferations of water- and nutrient-loving cattail plants. The team analyzed these changes, as well as changes in salinity and nutrients measured in wells in the region, to observe which areas had become saltier over time.

Each blue dot is a monthly reading. Some values are negative because sea level is reported relative to a reference point on dry land.  T. Tibbitts Source: S. Dessu Then, Dessu says, the researchers examined freshwater management practices. Since 1985, South Florida water managers have been gauging how much freshwater to release from the water conservation areas based on the amount of rainfall that fell 10 weeks earlier. In the dry season, that delay is a problem, the team reported in April in the Journal of Environmental Management. “By the time the flow is delivered, it’s two months too late,” Dessu says. The study concluded that the state’s water managers should consider not just how much water to send down into the Everglades, but when, exactly, would be the best time to do it. “That actually was kind of a surprise,” says Florida International University hydrogeologist René Price, a study coauthor. Managers can use the difference between measured freshwater level and seawater level to decide when best to deliver a plug of freshwater to maintain enough water pressure to help push seawater back, Dessu says. It’s a kind of Band-Aid fix — one that won’t solve the long-term problem of saltwater encroachment into the wetlands, but may at least ameliorate its immediate effects, he adds. Such fixes are, perhaps, the story of Everglades restoration. In fact, restoration is a misnomer, Sklar notes. “It’s not really possible to bring back the past.” Rehabilitation is more to the point. In March, Sklar and other South Florida water managers proposed an ambitious plan that could increase the overall flow of freshwater to the Everglades. The plan centers around the construction of a vast new water reservoir that would collect much of the fertilizer-polluted water from Lake Okeechobee to keep it from running to the coasts where it stimulates algal blooms. Within the reservoir, the water would be scrubbed, then sent to the wetlands. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approves the project, it will become part of legislation headed to Congress in the fall for approval, Sklar says. The Everglades water managers are walking a tightrope, juggling the needs of residents, farmers and business leaders who want a say about where the water goes. Conservationists in Florida understand this all too well. “If we made it all about climate change and sea level rise, there are those that wouldn’t be receptive,” Davis says. “So we talk about … issues like water supply and making the system more drought resilient.” “Let’s face it,” he adds. “Science is incredibly important in shaping Everglades restoration projects, but it’s politics that gets the projects authorized and ultimately built.” But he notes that researchers still have many questions about how best to save the Everglades. For example, Davis says, scientists are just beginning to examine whether increasing freshwater flow can even save the saw grass. Too much freshwater might, in fact, be a cure that’s worse than the disease. “There are models out there that show if we continue to release more freshwater to stem the tide of saltwater, it will end up just flooding the Everglades,” Price says, pointing to the push and pull. “We want to save the freshwater system, but how much flooding can it stand?” In fact, the best hope for Everglades rehabilitation may be the mangroves. The gnarled, salt-tolerant trees are a visible sign of how the ecosystem is already changing, as they steadily march into regions vacated by freshwater saw grass. Mangroves colonize new areas as their seeds wash inland. When the seeds settle into a spot, the plants can begin to grow, rapidly producing an abundance of fine roots — the primary component of peat soil. The trees can’t prevent all inundation or save the freshwater plants, but they may, at least, be able to keep the soil in place. But as with so much in the Everglades, it’s a question of timing, Price says. Mangroves can’t move in if the soil is already completely gone. The trees need enough sediment to establish a foothold. Once established, however, mangroves can build up soil quickly, perhaps even at a pace that matches sea level rise. “If they don’t, the peat collapse will take over,” Price says. “And it’ll just turn to open water.” This story appears in the August 18, 2018 issue of Science News with the headline, “Everglades on the Edge: Scientists wrestle with how to fight the effects of sea level rise.” "

Thousands of federal workers who handle food safety and public health are furloughed. Countless projects researching everything from climate change to pest control to hurricane prediction are on hold. Among government agencies hit by the partial shutdown are the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, where nearly all employees are on leave. Additionally, 40 percent of the Food and Drug Administration’s 14,000 workers are furloughed, as are most employees of the National Parks Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation, responsible for doling out nearly $8 billion in research funds each year, has stopped awarding grants and has canceled review panels with outside scientists that are part of the process. In 2018, NSF gave out $42 million in grants from January 1 through January 8, but this year, nothing has been funded so far, Benjamin Corb of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology noted in a statement January 8. Such stalled funding is leading to a backlog that could slow down approvals long beyond the shutdown. Here are some of the consequences of delaying government research, and how some scientists are trying to cope. Both the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remain funded and operational. Flu surveillance is still being funded through the CDC. Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs are also safe. But other agencies working to protect public health have scaled back operations. The Indian Health Service, which funds care for Native Americans, is in limbo. Health clinic employees are working without pay, while some grants and programs are on hold.    The USDA is still inspecting meat, dairy and poultry products. But routine FDA inspections of produce are suspended, increasing the possibility of a foodborne illness outbreak. Given that worry, the agency hopes to resume inspections of high-risk facilities prone to outbreaks, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb told the Washington Post.   Weather forecasts have become less accurate, with the National Weather Service’s key prediction tool not working correctly and no one around to fix it, the Washington Post also reported, citing Suru Saha of the National Weather Service’s Environmental Modeling Center in College Park, Md. Meanwhile, work to improve hurricane models by adding the latest in physics and data isn’t happening, forecaster Eric Blake at the National Weather Service’s National Hurricane Center in Miami told Scientific American. EPA employees policing industry compliance with laws restricting air and water pollution are on leave, and work to clean up Superfund sites, areas of extreme environmental contamination, is suspended. That means any research into the potential health or environmental effects of new contaminants is on hold. National parks are also in disarray, with few rangers to control crowds or enforce sanitation rules or regulations against environmental damage. Visitors wanting to drive off-road through the California desert cut down protected Joshua trees to clear a path in Joshua Tree National Park, park superintendent David Smith told National Parks Traveler. It can take years for desert soils and slow-growing Joshua trees to recover from such damage. Scientists aren’t able to gather data from government websites that are not being updated or are now offline. That’s hurt climate scientist Angeline Pendergrass’ work building computer models at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, to predict how climate change will impact rainfall patterns. Pendergrass normally verifies her calculations against precipitation records housed in the Global Historical Climatology Network, which logs global temperature and rainfall measurements. But while those data are still being collected automatically, the data aren’t available as usual through NOAA. Pendergrass’ project was stalled for days until she found a workaround to access the data in a different way. “I worry a lot about missing observations” from monitoring equipment malfunctions, Pendergrass says, which could mess up her research. Her concerns are well-founded. About 10 percent of contributing U.S. weather stations appear to be offline, lead scientist Robert Rohde at Berkeley Earth, an independent group for scientific analysis based in Berkeley, Calif., tweeted. And data from “a large number of foreign stations are also not being merged into the archive,” he wrote.   Animals in USDA facilities are still being cared for, but scientists can’t collect data or do experiments. Interruptions in animal research involving steps being taken at certain times — like cows that need to be bred at a certain age — can set researchers back months or even years. During the shutdown, federal scientists can’t attend scientific meetings — important arenas for sharing new research. Already, government scientists have missed key conferences on astronomy, biology, weather and agricultural science. More than 10 percent of planned participants at the American Astronomical Society meeting that just wrapped up on January 10 in Seattle had to cancel presentations, AAS spokesman Rick Fienberg says. Some were able to ask coauthors to take their place; astrophysicist Jane Rigby at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center was not one of them. Rigby had to abandon her planned talks about the James Webb Space Telescope because nobody outside of the U.S. space agency had the expertise to cover for her. “This is the Super Bowl of astronomy, and we’re not allowed to play,” she says. “It’s not even like we’re benched. We’re not even allowed in the stadium.” Hundreds of USDA employees have also pulled out of the San Diego meeting of the International Plant & Animal Genome that starts January 12, says conference co-organizer Alison Van Eenennaam, an agricultural genomicist at the University of California, Davis. Because future research priorities are decided at such conferences, she says, the cancelations “will have implications for the whole year’s research.” One of Van Eenennaam’s graduate students relies on a USDA computer server to run a simulation program for research that’s needed to complete her degree. She isn’t allowed to access it right now, so the planned updates to make the program more suitable to the project’s needs also aren’t happening. “She’s stuck,” Van Eenennaam says. Some scientists can ride out any funding delays. But for those working on projects that are time sensitive, the halt in funding approvals threatens to throw off an entire year of work. Physiologist Hannah Carey is still waiting for this year’s money to come in for her research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison on ground squirrel hibernation. Because hibernating animals endure extreme changes in body temperature and heart rate, studying how they cope could help scientists understand how human bodies deal with trauma or extreme conditions. “We’re OK for the time being,” she says, but the stopgap money from the university “isn’t an infinite well” and she doesn’t know how long it will last. Delaying the project is not an option, though; the research requires monitoring brief periods of arousal during squirrels’ natural hibernation cycles, and winter is when the squirrels in her lab are asleep. Regardless of the government, “the squirrels carry on.” Editor’s Note: Astronomy writer Lisa Grossman contributed to this story."

There’s much more important stuff. Like articulating the seriousness of climate change and searching for new knowledge that will aid in combatting it. Or coping with sexual harassment and discrimination. Or securing reliable funding from a nonfunctioning government. Not to mention figuring out what dark matter is. Still, maintaining sanity requires occasional diversion from all the sources of darkness, despair and despondency. In bleak days it sometimes helps to recall happier moments and reflect on some of science’s great accomplishments and the scientists responsible for them. Fortunately 2019 offers numerous opportunities for celebration, many more than can fit in a Top 10. So don’t be dismayed if your favorite isn’t listed (such as J. Presper Eckert’s centennial, John Couch Adams’ or Jean Foucault’s 200th birthday or Caroline Furness’ 150th). Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Unless you are an exceptionally serious botany fan, you’ve probably never heard of Cesalpino, born June 6, 1519. He was a physician, philosopher and botanist at the University of Pisa until the pope, in need of a good doctor, called him to Rome. As a medical researcher Cesalpino studied the blood and had some sense about its circulation long before the English physician William Harvey figured out the big blood picture. Cesalpino was most impressive as a botanist, generally credited with writing the first botany textbook. He didn’t get everything right, of course, but he described many plants accurately and classified them more systematically than previous researchers, who mostly regarded plants as a source for medicines. Today his name is memorialized by the flowering plant genus Caesalpinia. Less than a month before Cesalpino was born, Leonardo died, on May 2, 1519. Leonardo is much more famous in the popular mind as an artist than a scientist, but he was also a serious anatomist, geologist, engineer and mathematician (hello, Renaissance man). His role in the history of science was limited because so many of his ingenious ideas resided in notebooks that nobody read until long after his death. But he was a prolific and imaginative observer of the world. He developed elaborate geological views on river valleys and mountains (he thought the peaks of the Alps had once been islands in a higher ocean).  As an engineer, he recognized that complex machines combined a few simple mechanical principles, and he insisted on the impossibility of perpetual motion. He formulated basic ideas about work, power and force that became cornerstones of modern physics when developed more precisely by Galileo and others more than a century later. And of course, Leonardo probably would have invented the airplane if he had sufficient funding. Magnetism had been known since ancient times, as a property exhibited by certain iron-containing rocks known as lodestones. But nobody understood very much about it until Petrus Peregrinus (or Peter the Pilgrim) came along in the 13th century. He left behind very few clues about his personal life; nobody knows when he was born or died. But he must have been a profoundly talented mathematician and technician, praised profusely by the famously critical natural philosopher Roger Bacon (if the Peter he referred to was actually the Pilgrim). In any case, Peter composed the first substantial scientific treatise on magnetism (completed August 8, 1269), explaining the concept of magnetic poles. He even realized that if you broke a magnet into pieces, each piece became a new magnet with its own two poles — north and south, in analogy with the poles of the “celestial sphere” that supposedly carried the stars around the Earth. But Peter did not realize that compasses worked because the Earth itself is a giant magnet. Nor did he anticipate the laws of thermodynamics, designing what he thought was a magnetism-powered perpetual motion machine. Leonardo would have recommended against giving it a patent. On September 20, 1519, Ferdinand Magellan set sail from southern Spain with five ships on a transoceanic trek that would require three years to circumnavigate the globe. But Magellan made it only halfway, killed in a skirmish in the Philippines. Still, the voyage retains his name, although some modern sources prefer to call it the Magellan-Elcano expedition to include Juan Sebastián Elcano, commander of the Victoria, the only ship of the original five to make it back to Spain. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison noted that Elcano “finished the navigation, but he was only carrying out Magellan’s plan.” Among the great navigators of the Age of Discovery, Morison opined, “Magellan stands supreme,” and because of his contributions to navigation and geography, “the scientific value of this voyage is beyond doubt.” Although it certainly wasn’t necessary to sail around the Earth to prove that it was round, circumnavigating the globe for the first time surely qualifies as a significant human achievement, even if ranking slightly behind going to the moon. Apollo 11 was mainly a symbolic (though technically difficult) achievement, but nevertheless scientifically significant. Besides boosting the science of lunar geology by bringing back moon rocks, the Apollo astronauts deployed experiments to measure moonquakes (thereby learning more about the moon’s interior), studied the lunar soils and the solar wind, and left behind a mirror as a target for Earth-based lasers to measure the distance to the moon with high precision. (Later Apollo missions deployed more extensive experiments as well.) But even more than providing new scientific results, the Apollo mission represented a celebration of past scientific achievements — the understanding of the laws of motion and gravity and chemistry and propulsion (not to mention electromagnetic communication) —accumulated by earlier scientists who had no idea that their work would someday make Neil Armstrong famous. Born in Berlin on September 14, 1769, von Humboldt was perhaps the 19th century’s best candidate for the designation of Renaissance man. Not only a geographer, geologist, botanist and engineer, he was also a world-class explorer and one the most important writers of popular science of his century. With the botanist Aimé Bonpland, von Humboldt spent five years scouring South America and Mexico for new plants while also recording 23 volumes’ worth of observations on geology and minerals, meteorology and climate, and other geophysical data. He was both a deep and broad thinker, composing a five-volume work called Cosmos that essentially conveyed the totality of modern (as it was then) science to the general public. And he was also one of science’s leading humanitarians, arguing vigorously in opposition to slavery, racism and anti-Semitism.   An Englishman famous for an experiment showing the wave nature of light, Young was also a physician and linguist. This year’s anniversary celebration recognizes one of his more obscure papers, published two centuries ago (January 1819), on the math related to the probability of errors in scientific measurements. He commented on the use of probability theory to express the reliability of experimental results in “a numerical form.” He found it interesting to show why “the combination of a multitude of independent sources of error” has a natural tendency “to diminish the aggregate variation of their joint effect.” In other words, if you make a lot of measurements, the size of the probable error of your result will be smaller than if you make just one measurement. And math can be applied to estimate the probable size of the error. Young warned, though, that such methods could be misused: “This calculation has sometimes vainly endeavoured to substitute arithmetic for common sense,” he pointed out. It’s necessary to guard against any “constant causes of errors” (now known as “systematic errors”) in addition to random error. And he noted that it is “very seldom safe to rely on the total absence of such causes,” especially when the “observations are made by any one instrument, or even by any one observer.” Trust in math without concern for such considerations, he warned, could lead to erroneous conclusions: “For want of considering this necessary condition, the results of many elegant and refined investigations, relating to the probabilities of error, may in the end be found perfectly nugatory.” So there. Kepler, one of the greatest physicist-astronomers of the 17th century, attempted to reconcile the ancient idea of the harmony of the spheres with the modern astronomy that he had helped to establish. The original idea, attributed to the Greek philosopher-mathematician Pythagoras, was that spheres carrying the heavenly bodies around the Earth generated a musical harmony. Apparently nobody heard this music because, some Pythagoreans contended, it was present at birth and so was unnoticed background noise. Kepler believed the construction of the universe, with the sun rather than Earth at its center, observed harmonious mathematical ratios. He had long sought to explain the architecture of the solar system as corresponding to nested geometrical solids, thereby prescribing the distances separating the (elliptical) planetary orbits. In Harmonices Mundi (Harmony of the World), published in 1619, he admitted that solids alone could not accurately account for the details of planetary orbits — additional principles were needed. Most of his book is no longer relevant to astronomy, but its lasting contribution was Kepler’s third law of planetary motion, which showed the mathematical relationship between a planet’s distance from the sun and the time the planet takes to complete one orbit. Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, completed in 1915, predicted that light from a distant star passing near the sun would be bent by the sun’s gravity, altering the apparent position of the star in the sky. Newtonian physics could explain some such bending, but only half as much as Einstein had calculated. Observing such light seemed like a good way to test Einstein’s theory, except for the slight problem that you can’t see stars at all when the sun is in the sky. Both Newtonian and Einsteinian physics agreed, though, on when the next solar eclipse would be, making stars near the edge of the sun briefly visible. British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington led an expedition to observe an eclipse from an island off the coast of West Africa in May 1919. Eddington found that deviations for some stars from their previously recorded location matched general relativity’s forecast close enough to declare Einstein the winner. Apart from making Einstein famous, the result didn’t matter much at the time (apart from encouraging general relativity’s use in theorizing about cosmology). But general relativity became a big deal decades later, when it was needed to explain new astrophysical phenomena and also to make it possible for GPS devices to be accurate enough to do away with road maps. Dmitrii Mendeleev was not the first chemist to notice that several groups of elements had similar properties. But in 1869 he identified a guiding principle for classifying the elements: If you list them in order of increasing atomic weight, elements with similar properties recur at regular (periodic) intervals. Using this insight he created the first periodic table of the elements, one of the grandest accomplishments in the history of chemistry. Many of science’s great achievements appeared in the form of inscrutable mathematical formulas, or required elaborate experiments requiring intuitive genius, great manual dexterity, enormous cost or complex technology. But the periodic table is a wall chart. It allows anybody to grasp at a glance the foundations of an entire scientific discipline. Mendeleev’s table has often been reconstructed, and its guiding rule is now atomic number rather than atomic weight. But it remains the most versatile consolidation of profound scientific information ever constructed — an iconic representation of all the types of matter from which earthly substances are made. And you can find it not only on classroom walls, but also on ties, T-shirts and coffee mugs. Someday maybe it will decorate the walls of a chemistry-themed restaurant — called The Periodic Tables.

Will this be the region’s new normal?","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bering-sea-ice-disappearing-arctic-ecosystems","Peggy’s data were a bit of a shock. From an anchored vantage point in an expanse of the southeastern Bering Sea west of Alaska, Peggy, or mooring M2, had monitored conditions in the water for 25 years. A line of sensors extended down more than 70 meters to where Peggy was tethered to the seafloor, collecting information on temperature, salinity and other properties of the water. Most years, the waxing and waning of floating sea ice follows a consistent seasonal pattern that is reflected in Peggy’s data. By November, sea ice migrates in through the Bering Strait or forms in some parts of the Bering Sea. As a by-product of the sea ice formation, a large mass of cold, salty water begins to pool near the seafloor. In the spring, phytoplankton bloom, and by early summer, the sea ice begins to melt away. The cold pool, however, lingers through the summer. With an average temperature just below zero degrees Celsius — a few degrees colder than the surrounding water — that deep, cold pool is central to the Bering Sea ecosystem. The cold pool is where Arctic cod take refuge, hiding from predators such as Pacific cod and pollock, which are less tolerant of the cold. The Arctic cod get fat on large, shrimp-like copepods and spawn their young. In turn, the fish keep polar bears and seals well-fed. But in the winter of 2017–2018, the sea ice never appeared. And Peggy’s data, along with that of other moorings, revealed that the cold pool was AWOL too. Alarm trickled through the ocean science community, researchers who study everything from the physics of the Bering Sea to the small creatures that live on the seafloor and the larger marine mammals at the top of the food chain. In December in Washington, D.C., at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting, these researchers gathered to present their data, trade stories and ponder what it all means. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Were these findings a fluke? “We don’t yet have enough data” to say whether the Bering Sea is increasingly likely to be ice-free, says Jacqueline Grebmeier, a biological oceanographer at the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science in Solomons. But Grebmeier, who has studied seafloor life in the Arctic for more than 30 years, has “a gut feeling,” she says, that it’s not a one-off incident. “I think it’s the beginning of change.” If last year’s events represent a new normal for the Bering Sea (and the very low sea ice extent as of February this year signals they might), then a cascade of changes are in store for the complicated ecosystem that has long thrived in those waters — and for the fishing and tourism industries that rely on the area’s bounty. At their closest point, Alaska and Russia are separated by the 82-kilometer-wide Bering Strait. To the north of the strait lies the Chukchi Sea, on the edge of the Arctic Ocean; to the south is the Bering Sea, extending down to Alaska’s outflung arm of islands, the Aleutians. In the summer, the Bering Sea is largely ice-free, but in winter, ice forms in the northern Bering Sea, or migrates southward through the strait from the Chukchi. The waters reach “freeze-up” when there is at least 20 percent ice cover, scientists say. There were early signs that conditions in 2017 and 2018 were going to be different. By November 2017, the sea ice was already late. The air above the waves wasn’t especially warm. In fact, the air temperature was typical for that time of year, Phyllis Stabeno, a physical oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, reported at the December meeting. But an unusually persistent wind was blowing from the south, she said, preventing the ice from drifting down from the Chukchi Sea as it would normally. The wind tapered off by December and January, but by then air temperatures were higher than normal. The Chukchi Sea, normally at least 80 percent covered by thick, tough, icebreaker-testing pack ice by January, still had large open swaths of water. That meant less ice was available to migrate southward through the Bering Strait. Temperatures near the seafloor in the northern Bering Sea tend to hover around -1.5° Celsius in July, forming a “cold pool.” But in 2018, the average bottom water temperature was about 1.5°, signaling the absence of a cold pool that year. No data were collected in July 2009.  Summer temperatures near the northern Bering Sea floor Mooring M8, about 800 kilometers northwest of Peggy, had never recorded so little ice in the winter. M8, taking measurements since 2008, registered temperatures just above the seafloor that were more than 3 degrees C above normal. And Peggy, down by the Aleutians, had never recorded higher summertime water temperatures near the seafloor. That summer, the water never dropped below freezing. Then, in February, the strong southerly winds began again, and the unusual wind direction persisted through March; scientists suspect those winds kept the Chukchi Sea unusually warm, by pushing warmer waters from the Bering Sea northward. The warmer waters also prevented the formation of sea ice. The ice that did form in the Chukchi and Bering seas was thin and easily pushed back northward by the prevailing winds. Sea ice, whether migrating in or forming in place, is an anchoring part of the Bering Sea ecosystem. The ice helps determine when and where food becomes available to creatures living in the water or on the seafloor. As the migrating sea ice travels south, it melts. That meltwater is relatively fresh and less dense than the surrounding water. As a result, the waters become stratified, with the layer of fresher water staying on top. That freshwater, full of nutrients, helps give rise to the southern Bering Sea’s springtime phytoplankton blooms, which in turn feed copepods and other small floating creatures. When the phytoplankton eventually die and sink to the seafloor, they provide an important food source for creatures living on the bottom. But the absence of sea ice means that the water doesn’t stratify until later in the spring, and so the phytoplankton blooms happen later in the spring. Not every Bering Sea dweller will be quick to adjust to those delays in the ecosystem’s food web. “The timing is important,” Grebmeier says. “It’s a question of how fast [the animals] can adapt.” And thanks to the winds and warmth, little sea ice managed to form within the Bering Sea, which meant no deep, cold pool near the seafloor. Normally, the cold pool forms as a by-product of sea ice formation, especially in a region just south of St. Lawrence Island. Prevailing winds blowing south from the island create a space of open water called a polynya that freezes quickly in winter. As quickly as the ice forms, the winds blow it away from the island, opening up the water again to more freezing, creating a sea ice production line. All of that ice forming at that one spot pulls a lot of freshwater out of the sea; the water that’s left behind is salty and dense and sinks down to the seafloor, forming that pond of cold water that lingers throughout the summer. Although the dramatic absence of sea ice last winter was startling, waters in the Arctic have actually been on a decades-long warming trend. In the southern Chukchi Sea, freeze-up has happened about half a day later each year since 1981, Stabeno and colleagues reported in November in Deep-Sea Research. And in the northern Bering Sea, mooring M8’s data show particularly stark changes over the last four years. From 1981 to 2014, freeze-up happened on average by the end of December. But since 2014, freeze-up hasn’t occurred until January or February — or, in 2018, not at all. This warming trend has had trickle-down effects on the seafloor dwellers. Species such as bivalves that once carpeted the seafloor surrounding St. Lawrence Island, to the south of the strait, have shifted northward, Grebmeier says. In 2010, Grebmeier helped establish the Distributed Biological Observatory, an international effort to monitor long-term ecosystem changes in the Arctic by visiting designated “hot spots” year after year in the region, including the Bering and Chukchi seas. Those sites include the region just south of St. Lawrence Island, where the cold pool usually forms. Bivalves on the seafloor there used to provide a nutritious, fatty food for walruses and seals. And spectacled eiders — a kind of sea duck — dove for the mollusks, using the sea ice as a safe, stable launch pad. But over time, those bivalve patches have given way to marine worms, a far less nourishing food, Grebmeier says. For spectacled eiders, which are considered at risk of extinction in the near future, the food shift and the loss of sea ice is a one-two punch. “It takes less energy to sit on the ice and feed on underlying prey than to swim,” she says. “So the impact on these organisms is dramatic.” Other creatures in the Arctic have taken a hit as well. Researchers have measured an increase in the populations of small copepods that tiny larval pollock eat. But populations of fattier and more nourishing large copepods are in decline, which is bad news for juvenile fish that need the larger copepods to survive through the winter. The prey changes have had cascading impacts on the food web: Changes in the distribution and types of fish populations have spelled doom for thousands of seabirds. Last summer was the third year in a row with a massive seabird die-off, Calvin Mordy, a biological oceanographer with NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, reported at the December meeting. The seabirds showed evidence of starvation, he said, not disease. 2018’s record-setting low sea ice in the northern Bering Sea and a missing cold pool in the southern Bering took a toll on some species. Blue king crabs, ribbon seals and krill have decreased. Small copepods and urchins fared better. The combination of wind and warmth that led to the record-low sea ice in the Bering Sea, scientists say, was unusual based on past records. The question is how typical these conditions will be in the future, Stabeno says. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, with an average temperature about 1.7 degrees C above the long-term average during 1981 to 2000, according to the 2018 Arctic Report Card, NOAA’s annual report on the state of the Arctic. In fact, the five years since 2014 are the five warmest scientists have ever measured, says Emily Osborne, the lead editor of the 2018 report card and a climate scientist with NOAA’s Arctic Research Program in Silver Spring, Md. Last year was the second-warmest year on record, exceeded only by 2016, she says. One visible effect of the temperature rise is a sharp decline in summer sea ice cover, with the last 12 years being the 12 lowest on record. Rising air and ocean temperatures aren’t the only sign of change in the Arctic Ocean. The runoff from local rivers is having an impact. “It’s the most land-dominated ocean in the world,” says Karen Frey, a polar scientist at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “It’s a dumping ground for everything,” she adds, from sediment loads carried by rivers to dissolved organic matter to phytoplankton. “All roads lead to the Arctic.” In 2018, the volume of discharge of the eight largest rivers emptying into the Arctic Ocean was about 20 percent higher than it was in the 1980s, due to some combination of factors related to global warming, including increasing degradation of permafrost and increasing rainfall in the High Arctic. All of that material pouring into the ocean has resulted in a heightened supply of nutrients. The extra nutrients plus the warmer waters and more sunlight shining through — thanks to the missing or thinner sea ice — add up to larger phytoplankton blooms, Frey says. Some of that algal biomass — scientists don’t yet know how much — is toxic, akin to the deadly red tides blossoming along Florida’s coasts in recent years (SN: 9/29/18, p. 14). Such toxins can kill fish, as well as produce neurological damage in humans. Paralytic shellfish poisoning has increased seven-fold among Alaskans over the last 40 years, with the rise possibly caused by an increase in harmful algal blooms, Frey says. The state now has one of the highest incidences of shellfish poisoning in the world. The frequency and distribution of harmful algal blooms have both increased dramatically in recent years, prompting the first special section on harmful algal blooms included in the 2018 Arctic Report Card. The culprit algae may have “been present in many areas at low levels that wouldn’t be harmful. But the minute you start warming seawater … and removing sea ice, they adjust,” Frey says. “We are just starting to make measurements of harmful algal blooms and starting to understand how those species in the Arctic respond to light. It’s a very new question that has yet to be answered.” Frey, as part of the Distributed Biological Observatory program, visited the Bering Sea last July to measure how less sea ice, as well as thinner sea ice, changes the amount of light that reaches the waters to encourage blooms. Even the thinner ice — often covered with small melt ponds — could have a big effect on how much light penetrates, she found. The melt ponds “are basically skylights” for the waters below, she says. Having melt ponds on the surface of the sea ice can increase transmission of light into the water from perhaps 10 percent to as much as 60 or even 70 percent, Frey reported at the December meeting. The increase in phytoplankton blooms was particularly dramatic in 2018, the report card notes. Less sea ice and more melt ponds meant more light penetrated the Arctic’s waters earlier in the year, prompting blooms in the northern Bering Sea even as the south bloomed later. The northern waters, which normally see blooms in May, bloomed as early as March. The amount of algal biomass in March was about 275 percent higher than the average March biomass for 2003 to 2017. Scientists are still studying how much the harmful algal blooms may have contributed to excess seabird deaths. Bloom-related toxins have been implicated in other wildlife mass mortality events in the last few years, from walrus to seals to whales — animals that probably ate contaminated fish and shellfish, just like humans, the Arctic Report Card notes. As warming waters and decreasing ice cover create ever more favorable conditions for all algal blooms, the threat of harmful toxins will almost certainly contribute to economic losses for two of the region’s biggest industries: fishing and tourism. “Historically we shouldn’t be seeing another year like [2018], but under that argument, this year shouldn’t have happened,” Stabeno said in December. “What we saw this year was predicted to happen in 2050,” she added. “This gives us a view of the future.”"

Cars and trucks powered by lithium batteries rather than fossil fuels are, to many people, the future of transportation. Rechargeable lithium batteries are also crucial for storing energy produced by solar and wind power, clean energy sources that are a beacon of hope for a world worried about the rapidly changing global climate. Prospecting for new sources of lithium is booming, fueled by expectations that demand for lightweight, rechargeable lithium batteries — to power electric vehicles, cell phones, laptops and renewable energy storage facilities — is about to skyrocket. Even before electric cars, lithium was a hot commodity, mined for decades for reasons that had nothing to do with batteries. Thanks to lithium’s physical properties, it is bizarrely useful, popping up in all sorts of products, from shock-resistant glass to medications. In 2018, those products accounted for nearly half of the global lithium demand, according to analyses by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank. Batteries for consumer electronics, such as cell phones or laptops, accounted for another 25 percent or so of the demand. Electric vehicles accounted for most of the rest. Global estimated increase in demand for lithium in the next 10 to 15 years  That breakdown will soon be turned on its head: By 2025, as much as half of the demand for lithium will be from the electric vehicle industry, some projections suggest. Global demand for the metal is expected to rise at least 300 percent in the next 10 to 15 years, in large part because sales of electric vehicles are expected to increase dramatically. Right now, there are about 2 million electric vehicles on the road worldwide; by 2030, that number is projected to grow to over 24 million, according to the industry research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Electric vehicle giant Tesla has been on a worldwide quest for lithium, inking deals to obtain lithium supplies from mining operations in the United States, Mexico, Canada and Australia. As a result, lithium prices in global markets have been on a roller coaster in the last few years, with a sharp spike in 2018 due to fears that there just might not be enough of the metal to go around. But those doomsday scenarios are probably a bit overwrought, says geologist Lisa Stillings of the U.S. Geological Survey in Reno, Nev. Lithium makes up about 0.002 percent of Earth’s crust, but in geologic terms, it isn’t particularly rare, Stillings says. The key, she adds, is knowing where it is concentrated enough to mine economically. To answer that question, researchers are studying how and where the forces of wind, water, heat and time combine to create rich deposits of the metal. Such places include the flat desert basins of the “lithium triangle” of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia; volcanic rocks called pegmatites in Australia, the United States and Canada; and lithium-bearing clays in the United States. The hunt to find and extract this “white gold” is also spurring new basic geology, geochemistry and hydrology research. Stillings and other scientists are examining how clays and brines form, how lithium might move between the two deposits when both occur in the same basin and how lithium atoms tend to position themselves within the chemical structure of the clay.  Lithium, in its elemental form, is soft and silvery and light, with a density about half that of water. It’s the lightest metal on the periodic table. The element was discovered in 1817 by Swedish chemist Johan August Arfwedson, who was analyzing a grayish mineral called petalite. Arfwedson identified aluminum, silicon and oxygen in the mineral, which together made up 96 percent of the mineral’s mass. The rest of the petalite, he determined, was made up of some sort of element that had chemical properties similar to potassium and sodium. All three elements are highly reactive with other charged particles, or ions, to form salts, are solid but soft at room temperature, have low melting points and tend to dissolve readily in water. Thanks to their similarities, these elements, along with rubidium, cesium and francium, were later grouped together as “alkali metals,” forming most of the periodic table’s Group 1 (SN: 1/19/19, p. 18). Lithium’s affinity for water helps explain how it moves through Earth’s crust and how it can become concentrated enough to mine. The basic recipe for any kind of lithium-rich deposit includes volcanic rocks plus a lot of water and heat, mixed well by active tectonics. Worldwide, there are three main sources of lithium: pegmatites, brines and clays. Most pegmatites are a type of granite formed out of molten magma. What makes pegmatites interesting is that they tend to contain a lot of incompatible elements, which resist forming solid crystals for as long as possible. The rocks form as the magma beneath a volcano cools very slowly. The magma’s chemical composition evolves over time. As elements drop out of the liquid to form solid crystals, other elements, like lithium, tend to linger in the liquid, becoming more and more concentrated. But eventually, even that magma cools and crystallizes, and the incompatibles are locked into the pegmatite. Before the 1990s, pegmatites in the United States were the primary source of mined lithium. But extracting lithium ore, primarily a mineral called spodumene, from the rock is costly. On top of the cost of actual mining, the rock has to be crushed and treated with acid and heat to extract the lithium in a commercially useful form. In the 1990s, a much cheaper source of lithium became an option. Just beneath the arid salt flats spanning large swaths of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia circulates salty, lithium-enriched groundwater. Miners pump the salty water to the surface, sequestering it into ponds and letting it evaporate in the sun. “Mother Nature does most of the work, so it’s really cheap,” Stillings says. What’s left behind after the evaporation is a sludgy, yellowish brine. To extract battery-grade lithium in commercially useful forms, particularly lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, the miners add different minerals to the brine, such as sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide. Reactions with those minerals cause different types of salts to precipitate out of the solution, ultimately producing lithium minerals. Compared with pegmatite extraction, the process for extracting lithium from the brine is extremely cheap; as a result, brine mining currently dominates the lithium market. But in the hunt for more lithium, the next generation of prospectors are looking to a third type of deposit: clay. Clays are the hardened remnants of ancient mud, produced by the slow settling of tiny grains of sediment, such as within a lake bed. To get lithium-enriched clay requires the right starting ingredients, particularly lithium-bearing rocks such as pegmatite and circulating groundwater. The groundwater leaches the lithium from the rocks and transports it to a lake where it becomes concentrated in the sediments. The western United States, it turns out, has all the right ingredients to make lithium-rich clay. In fact, in 2017 in Nature Communications, researchers suggested that some ancient supervolcano craters that became lakes, such as the Yellowstone caldera, would be excellent sources of lithium.  Beneath North America lies a shallow pool of magma that feeds the Yellowstone supervolcano. For the last 2 million years or so, Yellowstone volcanism has been located in northwestern Wyoming (and is the centerpiece of Yellowstone National Park). But the Yellowstone hot spot isn’t stationary. Over the last 16 million years, as the North American plate has slowly slid to the southwest, it has moved over the stationary, shallow magma body, leaving a pockmarked track of volcanic craters stretching from Nevada to Yellowstone. One of the oldest known Yellowstone craters, called McDermitt Caldera, filled with water, then later dried up, leaving behind a potential treasure trove of lithium-rich clay. Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corp., which plans to begin mining operations at a site called Thacker Pass within the caldera in 2022, estimates that by 2025, the lake bed could provide as much as 25 percent of the world’s lithium. In the United States, Stillings says, McDermitt is “one of the very large resources that we know exists.” But lithium clays have some hurdles to clear before they can compete with brines. Retrieving the lithium ore requires open-pit mining, which is more expensive than pumping up the brine. And processing the clay to extract lithium carbonate or other industry-ready minerals is also pricey. Lithium Americas and other companies that claim to have developed their own clean, inexpensive extraction processes haven’t yet demonstrated that they will be competitive with brine mining. Most of the world’s lithium sources (orange) are pegmatite mines in Australia and China and brine mines in Chile and Argentina. But planned mining ventures (blue) mean that the lithium rush will soon spread to the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Known sources of lithium around the world Source: USGS Several other types of lithium extraction may be on the horizon, Stillings says. Lithium-rich brines can also form in tectonically active geothermal regions, where there is a lot of heat in the subsurface. Geothermal power plants already pump up the superheated water to generate energy, then inject it back into the subsurface. Some facilities are experimenting with extracting other commercially valuable elements from the brine, including lithium, manganese and zinc. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, also involves pumping up brines from the subsurface that may contain high levels of dissolved metals, possibly including lithium. Although the lithium may not be present in very high concentrations, the extraction could still be economically worthwhile, if it’s a by-product of mining already going on. In December 2017, the White House issued an executive order directing the U.S. Department of the Interior to ramp up research on new sources of certain “critical minerals,” including ores bearing lithium. Citing the economy and national security, the order instructed government scientists to analyze each link in the minerals’ supply chains, from exploration to mining to production, in hopes that new sources could be found within U.S. borders. The United States isn’t alone in the rush to find lithium. China, the European Union and others are on the hunt for new sources. In January, a consortium of EU researchers launched a two-year initiative called the European Lithium Institute to become competitive in the lithium market. To kick off this new phase in lithium research, Stillings helped convene a symposium at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, D.C., last December. “We would like to understand how lithium cycles through Earth’s crust,” Stillings says. “Lithium is very soluble; it likes to be in solution. However, we’ve learned that as it moves through the crust, it does interact with clays.” Lithium is useful for a lot more than batteries. Below are some common products and the lithium compounds they contain. Mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder: Lithium has been used as a medication for conditions ranging from gout to mental disorders since the mid-19th century. Taken as lithium carbonate or lithium citrate, lithium has been in widespread use to treat acute mania, an aspect of bipolar disorder, since the 1970s. However, scientists still aren’t sure why the treatment works. Due to their smaller size, charged particles, or ions, of lithium may substitute for potassium, sodium or calcium ions in certain enzymes and chemicals in the brain. Substituting lithium may reduce the sensitivity of certain receptors, making them less likely to connect to brain chemicals such as norepinephrine, which is known to be overabundant during mania. Cosmetics: Lithium stearate acts as an emulsifier, keeping oils and liquids from separating in foundations, face powders, eye shadows and lipsticks. When added to face creams, a soft, greasy, lithium-bearing mineral called hectorite keeps the product smooth and spreadable. Military, industrial, automotive, aircraft and marine applications: When added to petroleum, lithium stearate creates a thick lubricating grease that is waterproof and tolerant of high and low temperatures. Shock-resistant cookware and aluminum foil: Compared with the other alkali metals, lithium atoms are small, particularly in their charged state. Lithium ions expand relatively little as they get hotter, so adding some lithium carbonate to glass or ceramics can make those products stronger and less likely to shatter when hot.  Lithium isotopes — it has two, lithium-6 and lithium-7 — are one way to track this exchange. “They are like a fingerprint,” says Romain Millot, a geologist with the French Geological Survey and the University of Orléans in France. The different masses of the two isotopes influence how they move between water and solid rock: Lithium-6 prefers to leave the water and bind into clay grains, compared with lithium-7. The isotopes are also proving useful at revealing the influences of weathering, water flow and heat on concentrating lithium, Millot says. Because water is so important for concentrating lithium, researchers are shifting away from a classic “find the ore” framework, says Scott Hynek, a USGS geologist based in Salt Lake City. Instead, “we’re taking a more petroleum-like perspective,” he says. Scientists are tracking not just where deposits are, but how they might move: where the water flows, where the lithium-rich fluid could become trapped beneath a layer of hard, impermeable rock. Lithium prospecting is also taking a page from the hydrology playbook, using some classic tools of that trade to track the circulation of groundwater through the subsurface to suss out where lithium-rich deposits might end up. Isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen and helium are used to track how long the groundwater has been traveling through the subsurface as well as the types of rocks that the water has been in contact with. Faults, for example, can channel subsurface water, and therefore may play a big role in shaping where lithium deposits might form. “It’s an unresolved question,” Hynek says. “These are big-scale geologic controls on where high-lithium water goes.” He presented data at the AGU symposium suggesting that the highest lithium concentrations in a Chilean salt flat known as the Salar de Atacama occur near certain fault lines. That, he says, suggests the faults are helping to channel the groundwater and thereby concentrating the deposits. One looming problem for lithium mining is that even “clean” energy isn’t completely clean. Extracting lithium from its ore and converting it into a commercially usable form such as lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide can produce toxic waste, which can leak into the environment. Chemical leaks from a lithium mine in China’s Tibetan Plateau have repeatedly wreaked havoc on the environment since 2009, killing fish and livestock that drank from a nearby river. Even when Mother Nature is doing much of the work, such as in evaporation ponds, there can be negative effects on the environment. In South America, for example, the problem is water supply. The lithium triangle, which includes Salar de Atacama, is one of the driest places on Earth — and mining consumes a lot of water. And that’s producing a worrisome confluence of events. Just at the edges of the Salar de Atacama salt flats is a flamingo nesting habitat: brackish lagoons filled with brine shrimp. “One of the major oppositions to this mining activity is the impact it has potentially on flamingo populations,” Hynek says. The same water source in the Andes that feeds the subsurface lithium brine reservoir also, ultimately, fills the lagoons. In fact, the water table is already dropping in some places in the region, and indigenous communities, as well as both Chilean and Argentinian authorities, are on high alert, Hynek says. “Chilean authorities are worried that [miners] will pump so much that the lagoon water levels will also drop.” In February, Chile announced new restrictions on water rights for miners operating in Salar de Atacama. Who’s to blame is the subject of a lot of debate. In addition to the lithium brine mining, copper mines high up in the Andes — where the groundwater originates — are extracting a substantial amount of water from the system. “The flamingos and the indigenous communities are literally stuck in the middle,” Hynek adds. Such big environmental concerns could hamper future prospects for mining in the region. “You’re making the brine in the same area where you’re sustaining these important biodiversity habitats,” says David Boutt, a hydrologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  There is so far little research on how water moves through the subsurface in dry areas with very low precipitation rates, such as South America’s lithium triangle, Boutt adds. “There are a lot of questions about where the water is coming from,” such as how variable the water flow rate is through the ground. “It can take a very long time for these systems to respond” to perturbations such as groundwater pumping. The effects of withdrawing the briny waters now might not be felt for perhaps decades. “A concern,” Boutt says, “is whether we are going to be waiting 100 years before something bad happens.” This article appears in the May 11, 2019 issue of Science News with the headline, “Looking for Lithium: The lightest metal on the periodic table is key to clean energy’s future.”"

Those “stories” and other falsified news outperformed much of the real news on Facebook before the 2016 U.S. presidential election. And on Twitter, an analysis by University of Southern California computer scientists found that nearly 20 percent of election-related tweets came from bots, computer programs posing as real people and often spouting biased or fake news. If you care about science, that’s a big problem. As daily news moves past the election, the fake news machine isn’t likely to shut down; it will just look for new kinds of attention-grabbing headlines. Fake news about climate change, vaccines and other hot-button science topics has already proven to get clicks. And if you think only people on the opposite side of the political fence from you will fall for lies, think again. We all do it. Plenty of research shows that people are more likely to believe news if it confirms their preexisting political views, says cognitive scientist David Rapp of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. More surprising, though, are Rapp’s latest studies along with others on learning and memory. They show that when we read inaccurate information, we often remember it later as being true, even if we initially knew it was wrong. That misinformation can then bias us or affect our decisions. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox So just reading fake news can taint you with misinformation. In several experiments, Rapp’s team asked people to read short anecdotes or statements that contained either correct information or untruths. One example of untruthiness: The capital of Russia is St. Petersburg. (It’s Moscow.) Then the researchers surprised these people with a trivia quiz, including some questions about the “facts.” It turns out that people who read the untruths consistently gave more incorrect answers than those who read true or unrelated information, even if they had looked up the correct information previously. Troublingly, these people also then tended to believe that they had already known those incorrect facts before the experiment, showing how easy it is to forget where you “learned” something. Whether someone can identify the capital of Russia may not seem important, but assertions involving incorrect scientific concepts (such as “brushing your teeth too much can lead to gum disease”) worked the same way in the experiments, and people used the incorrect information to make judgments. So someone who hears over and over again that “trees cause more pollution than automobiles do” might use that incorrect fact to oppose environmental regulations. In fact, I worry that just by me repeating that tired old line, you’ll remember it. Even more alarming, we also pick up incorrect information from pure fiction, such as novels. Research finds that when we read fictional stories, we don’t just remember facts and plotlines. We use remembered bits of information to make deductions about how the world works, like a sorely misguided Sherlock Holmes. And again, knowing it’s fiction doesn’t help. This means we now have a public unwittingly armed to assess fake news about GMOs using a genetics lesson gleaned from Jurassic Park. Part of the problem lies in how our brain forms memories. For one, the more often a message is repeated (say on Facebook and Twitter), the more likely we are to remember it, an effect called fluent retrieval. That’s fine, but then our brains go one step further. “When we can remember something more easily, we’re more likely to believe it’s true,” says Rapp. This is one of the reasons that the social media echo chamber is so effective. Repeat a lie often enough, and it starts to feel like truth. “I’ve had cases on my own Facebook feed,” says Rapp, “where people repeat a message they disagree with in an attempt to prove it wrong, and they accidentally amplify it.” If you think you’ve never shared fake news, I have more bad news. We’re pretty bad at distinguishing fake news from real on social media, says Emilio Ferrara of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Ferrara published his findings of widespread Twitter bots in the run-up to the election in First Monday, a computer science journal focused on the internet. He found that human Twitter users retweeted messages from bots at the same rate as messages from real people, “which means that the average user most likely retweets this content unconditionally,” he says. “It was an unexpected finding, because as an informed reader, I don’t retweet everything I see. But we see systematic lack of a critical ability to distinguish sources.” Are we doomed, then, to repeat fake news until it becomes real in our minds? Rapp says no, but we’ll need to dust off the critical-thinking skills we learned in grade school. First, we have to work extra hard while reading to not only remember a fact, but to remember that it’s false. “One idea is that when we encode problematic information as memory, unless we tag it as ‘wrong,’ we might accidentally retrieve that wrong info as real,” Rapp says. In his experiments, people were better at remembering which facts were false if they fact-checked and corrected information as they read, or at least highlighted incorrect facts. Explicitly noticing when something might be untrue, and then making an effort to fact-check it, can go a long way, Rapp says. That could be as simple as doing a Google search or checking a site like Snopes.com. Taking mental note of a story’s source and whether it’s reliable helps, too. In general, reinforcing correct knowledge in our memory as we read and compartmentalizing incorrect facts into a “not true” mental category can help keep our brains from becoming a murky fact stew. In the end, the solution to the fake news problem lies in our own brains. While Facebook and Google try to block fake news with algorithms and starve it of ad dollars, the only way to really curb it is for readers to recognize it, and not share it."

Today we know it was just a blip, and that Earth’s climate is warming thanks to industrial activity over the last century.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-puzzled-over-slight-global-cooling","Earth’s cooling climate, Science News, November 15, 1969 — The average temperature for the entire Earth rose gradually from the 1880s until the early 1940s. At that time, a cooling trend suddenly set in which is continuing today.… The amount of dust and other particulate matter in the atmosphere has increased dramatically in recent decades, a change that could counteract the thermal effect of carbon dioxide buildup. From 1940 to about 1975, the average global surface temperature decreased by about 0.1 degrees Celsius, interrupting a decades-long warming trend even as carbon emissions continued to rise. Many scientists thought the cooling trend was possibly caused by sulfate particles from the burning of fossil fuels that can scatter sunlight and reduce atmospheric warming (SN: 11/21/09, p. 5). That hunch proved correct: When the United States and other countries began to lower sulfur emissions in the 1970s to reduce acid rain and respiratory illnesses, the cooling ended abruptly. Since 1975, the average global temperature has risen by about 0.6 degrees C. Today, the average surface temperature is 1.1 degrees C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times (SN: 9/25/19). However, ongoing sulfate emissions, particularly from China and India, may still be slowing greenhouse gas-driven warming. Removing all aerosol emissions from the world at once could add about 0.7 degrees C to global temperatures. "
"494","Why this warmer world is not just a passing phase","Editor in Chief Nancy Shute discusses climate change and the uncertainty of science.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-warmer-world-not-just-passing-phase","In the late 1990s, three scientists published a paper charting the Earth’s temperatures over the last millennium. For the first 900 years, the trend line was the definition of boring: just little blips up and down. That changed around 1900, when the mean global temperature shot up, and kept rising. That now-famous trend line, dubbed “the hockey stick” because of its sharp upward slope, is so vivid that it has played a key role in two decades of argument over whether the Earth’s atmosphere is warming, and whether those changes are caused by heat-trapping gases generated by human activities.  It’s not hard to pick apart a single study’s data. Critics of the hockey stick pointed to centuries-long temperature shifts such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age to argue that anomalies in the 20th century were also short-term, natural shifts. Critics also noted the patchwork nature of the pre-1900 data, which didn’t rely on direct measurements, and said there was no direct evidence that increased greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels was causing the current temperature rise. Uncertainty is central to the enterprise of science. It’s a rare day when a single study — or dozens, or hundreds — answers a question without a doubt. And because uncertainty almost always remains, scientists have to explain both quantitatively and qualitatively how uncertain they are. That’s good science. But climate change naysayers used that uncertainty to say, “The scientists aren’t sure.” And it meant that when we journalists reported accurately on the science by noting uncertainty, we gave more ammunition to doubters. Well, scientists are now sure. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international consortium convened by the United Nations to evaluate the science of climate, released a report saying there was greater than 95 percent certainty that the substantial warming was due to human activities. And scientists are increasingly linking extreme weather events worldwide, from heat waves to hurricanes, to human-caused climate change (SN: 1/19/19, p. 7). In this issue, we report on how the city of Boston is regularly flooding due to rising sea levels. Freelancer Mary Caperton Morton explains how policy makers and scientists are racing to develop responses to keep the venerable city functioning as the water moves inland. And earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling reports on a startling new study that lays to rest the argument that the warming we’re experiencing is just another normal climate shift. This one is clearly different, the data show: Those earlier temperature fluctuations were regional; what’s happening now is worldwide.  Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State who is one of the researchers who developed the hockey stick data chart, said back in 2005 that he thought that people wouldn’t take climate change seriously until they saw it in their own backyards. People in Boston think they’re seeing it, as do people in many other communities around the world who are bracing for more extreme heat, rainfall, drought and storms. Our charge at Science News is to continue to report on the science while chronicling humankind’s responses, for good or ill. "
"495","Is climate change causing Europe’s intense heat? A scientist weighs in","Science News talks with climate scientist Karsten Haustein about attributing extreme heat events in Europe and South Asia to climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-heat-wave","Mainland Europe has sweltered for days under record-breaking temperatures, prompting researchers to try to untangle how much of the heat wave can be linked to climate change. A report on that, by an international consortium of scientists called the World Weather Attribution Network, is expected to be released on July 2. Previous heat records for many parts of Europe were set in the summer of 2003, when temperatures soared to 44.1° Celsius (111.4° Fahrenheit) in the southern French town of Conqueyrac. That extreme heat killed more than 70,000 people across the continent — a death toll  that researchers determined was amplified by climate change (SN: 9/3/16, p. 5). Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox As another heat wave in 2018 baked Europe for three months, the consortium conducted a rapid assessment that determined it could not have happened without anthropogenic, or human-caused, climate change. Such events could occur yearly if global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the researchers found. If global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, though, such events were predicted every two out of three years. This year’s event, which began in mid-June, is expected to be shorter. But it is intense. On June 28, temperatures in Gallargues-le-Montueux, a city in southern France, hit 45.9° C (114.6° F), smashing temperature records for the country. But Europe isn’t the only part of the world dealing with dangerous heat levels. India and Pakistan have been suffering since mid-May under one of the longest-lasting heat waves in its recent history. In June, temperatures in New Delhi soared to 48° C (118.4° F), the highest ever recorded for the month in the Indian capital. By June 21, at least 180 people reportedly had died from heat-related causes. Science News spoke with Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford in England who is affiliated with the consortium, about what’s behind these deadly events and how scientists determine in real time whether a particular heat wave can be attributed to climate change. His comments have been edited for clarity and brevity. SN: Why was the World Weather Attribution Network created? Haustein: The idea was that we would look at any given extreme events while they’re happening and try to scientifically attribute the climate change factor. For example, has it become a more likely event or not [due to climate change]? We define the event, put it into historic context — for example, is it a 1-in-100-year event? — and determine if it’s setting records or getting media attention. And then we do the model analyses to isolate the climate signal. We’re also teaching other researchers, in places including Kenya, South Africa and Australia, how to use our methods. SN: Why are you analyzing the current Europe heat wave? Haustein: This current heat wave just started 10 days ago. [By June 24], it was already shaping up to be pretty extreme, so we went for it. The all-time maximum temperature in France was 44.1° C, from August 2003. That was a really bad one. There are chances we’ll get up to 45° C, which would be quite a new record. [A few hours after this interview, that milestone was reached on June 28.] For June, that’s pretty epic. Germany’s temperatures will peak on Sunday [June 30], and probably Monday [July 1] in Austria. And then there are two cold fronts that will be pushing through. SN: What atmospheric conditions are causing the intense heat? Haustein: To get a heat wave going, you need warm air in the upper level [of the atmosphere]. That comes from the south, from Africa. We actually set a record [on June 27] for temperatures at 1.5 kilometers above Earth’s surface, reaching 25.5° C. How those upper-level air masses translate into temperatures on the surface is a different story. In simple terms, the jet stream where it sits across Europe divides colder air in the north from warmer air in the south. Sometimes [this fast current of air above the Northern Hemisphere] becomes very wiggly, with big loops going far to the north and all the way down to northern Africa. That can transport really hot air from Africa to Europe. If it sits over Europe for several days, it can heat the surface. What’s causing that wiggly jet stream is contentious. Some people have suggested it’s linked to increasing temperatures in the Arctic. But we don’t really know. All we can say is that, over the last 10 days, there’s been a tendency to have this pattern: We see the jet stream digging farther south, and Europe is sitting in this warm air. Extreme temperatures scorched much of India and Pakistan from mid-May through June 2019. NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System, a global atmospheric climate simulation, created this map of air temperatures across the region on June 10. Several factors contributed to the heat wave, including a delayed monsoon. The health impacts of South Asia’s rising temperatures are unclear, though, due to other factors that can impact health, including higher humidity and air pollution levels in the region. And it’s also not yet clear if the region has been seeing an overall trend of increasing maximum air temperatures since the 1970s. NASA Earth Observatory SN: What about the heat wave in South Asia?  Haustein: As far as climate attribution, it’s similar to work we did on the 2016 heat wave in India. [That heat wave included a record-breaking temperature of 51° C in the western state of Rajasthan.] India’s 2019 temperatures appear to be due to natural year-to-year variability. We did a brief analysis that found that maximum temperatures across India in the hottest months aren’t clearly increasing. SN: What did the consortium learn in analyzing the 2018 European heat wave? Haustein: We know that the frequency and intensity of heat waves are increasing globally. Heat waves in Europe, such as the one in 2018, are at least twice as likely to occur now as a result of climate change."
"496","How today’s global warming is unlike the last 2,000 years of climate shifts","Temperatures at the end of the 20th century were hotter almost everywhere on the planet than in the previous two millennia.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-today-unlike-last-2000-years-climate-shifts","Temperatures across 98 percent of Earth’s surface were hotter at the end of the 20th century than at any time in the previous 2,000 years. Such nearly universal warming, occurring in lockstep across the planet, is unique to this current era, scientists say. By contrast, other well-known cold and warm snaps of the past, such as the Little Ice Age or the Medieval Warm Period, were, in fact, regional rather than worldwide. What’s more, the rate at which temperatures are increasing now far exceeds any previous temperature fluctuations measured in the last two millennia. Those are the conclusions of a trio of new papers examining temperature trends over the last 2,000 years, published online July 24 in Nature and Nature Geoscience. Those previous climate fluctuations were primarily driven by natural causes, including powerful volcanic eruptions, rather than human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.   Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The findings, which are based on newly available global paleoclimate data, reinforce an inescapable conclusion, says Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University who was not involved in the new studies: “The current period of warmth is unprecedented in its global scope in the last 2,000 years.” In the Nature study, a team led by Raphael Neukom, a climate scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, used many different types of temperature records from around the world to create thousands of climate reconstructions of the last two millennia, from A.D. 1 to 2000. Those data were collected by an international group of scientists called the PAGES 2k Consortium. They include proxies for temperatures derived from tree rings, glacier ice cores, lake and ocean sediments, cave deposits such as stalactites and stalagmites and historical documents (SN: 10/28/17, p. 29). Using those data, as well as direct temperature measurements collected in some locations since the 1800s and some climate simulations, the team produced more than 15,000 different climate reconstructions of past global temperatures. Then, the researchers took a close look at the precise timing of warming or cooling within four previously identified “climate epochs” — the Roman Warm Period from about A.D. 1 to 300, the Dark Ages Cold Period from 400 to 800, the Medieval Warm Period from about 800 to 1200 and the Little Ice Age from 1300 to 1850. Well-known climate fluctuations of the last 2,000 years were once thought to be global. But research using newly available temperature proxy data from around the planet reveals that these fluctuations were regional. In each map, different colors represent the warmest (or coldest) century for a given location within the represented time period. For example, the Dark Ages Cold Period is thought to span from about A.D. 400 to 800. But colder temperatures occurred several hundred years earlier in the Pacific Ocean (white to pale purple) and several hundred years later in East Asia and other locations (darker purple). Similarly, the Medieval Warm Period (or Medieval Climate Anomaly) lasted roughly from 800 to 1200, with peak warmth occurring during the 11th century in northwestern Europe (orange). But central South America saw peak warmth several hundred years later (brown). Across all 2,000 years included in the new research, however, temperatures were hottest at the end of the 20th century for 98 percent of the planet (shown in the third map). Cold and warm snaps of the past were regional, unlike current global warming Although the same datasets were input into the climate reproductions, the team used different methodologies, varying widely in computational complexity, to process the data and calculate past temperatures. Regardless of which method was used, the story was the same, the researchers found: Those past climate epochs were not simultaneous, global events. The Little Ice Age, for example, was a cold snap thought to have lasted from roughly 1350 to 1850. But the deep freezes didn’t occur everywhere at the same time, the new analysis shows. Northwestern Europe and southeastern North America got their coldest temperatures during the 17th century, while the area encompassing the central and eastern Pacific Ocean were coldest two hundred years earlier, during the 15th century, the team found. The Medieval Warm Period, also called the Medieval Climate Anomaly, showed the warmest temperatures in northwestern Europe and eastern North America during the 11th century. But peak warmth occurred several hundred years later in central South America, and several hundred years earlier in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. “The traditional understanding is that these [climate epochs, like the Little Ice Age] were global-scale phenomena,” says Nathan Steiger, a climate scientist at Columbia University. “That’s not the case.” That finding stands in stark contrast to the team’s conclusions about the current era of warming: It is occurring concurrently around the globe, with the hottest temperatures in the study found to be right at the end of the 20th century. “It is coherent in a way we didn’t experience over the last 2,000 years,” Steiger says. Because the study’s temperature data go only to 2000, the last two decades of temperatures weren’t included. But NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported in February that nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the last five years were the five hottest on record (SN Online: 2/6/19). Human activities have been repeatedly cited by scientists as the cause of these ongoing record-breaking temperatures (SN Online: 7/2/19). At a news conference on July 22, Steiger noted that the Nature study didn’t specifically mention that the current warming is due to anthropogenic activities, in part because so many previous studies have repeatedly and clearly demonstrated that link. “We don’t need to look at paleoclimate to know that.” A second study, published in Nature Geoscience, does address the question of anthropogenic warming more explicitly. The study, authored by Neukom and other members of the PAGES 2k Consortium, used the same temperature proxies as the Nature study. But instead of comparing spatial patterns of warming and cooling around the globe, the team looked at the average global temperature through time. That, Neukom said at the news conference, revealed that the current rate of warming is much faster than anything observed in the last 2,000 years that can be attributed to natural variability. “It’s another angle to look at the extraordinary nature of current warming,” he said. A third study, also in Nature Geoscience, added another layer of context to the trends, by looking at what natural forces may have been behind large regional temperature fluctuations such as the Little Ice Age. Led by University of Bern climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann, the researchers found that before the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1800s, powerful volcanic eruptions were the main engine behind such large-scale temperature fluctuations. For instance, five powerful eruptions, including the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, occurred toward the end of the Little Ice Age, which began around 1350 and ended around 1850 (SN: 7/7/18, p. 32). The eruptions initially led to cooling and climate upheaval, and then a period of recovery as the planet warmed up again. That recovery coincides with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, at which point greenhouse gases became the primary driver for warming, the researchers note. Mann notes that the studies’ findings — that these past climate epochs weren’t global and that current warming is proceeding at an unprecedented rate — aren’t exactly new ideas. In 1998, he and colleagues published a famous study in Nature, sometimes referred to as the “hockey stick” paper, that revealed a dramatic upward tick in temperatures at the end of the 20th century — a pattern that, when plotted through time, takes the shape of a hockey stick. “It’s gratifying that independent, international teams using entirely different approaches have come to virtually identical conclusions,” Mann says. Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who coauthored the hockey stick study, agrees. “In that paper, we were widely criticized for saying the last decade was the warmest in the last 1,000 years,” he says. Bradley adds that the new studies are a valuable addition, with a “high quality, carefully screened set of data” as well as powerful simulations that can synthesize and reproduce those past temperatures. “They’ve done everything right,” he adds. But the PAGES 2k database of temperature proxies still contains some glaring holes, particularly in tropical regions and in the oceans. Such data won’t change the underlying storyline, but could help scientists see global temperature fluctuations even more clearly, Bradley says. Efforts to collect more temperature data from South America are already afoot, from cave formations across Brazil and Argentina as well as from ancient trees in the Amazon forest, he adds, and “that’s exactly what’s needed.”"
"497","How climate change is already altering oceans and ice, and what’s to come","A new IPCC report gives the lowdown on how climate change is already wreaking havoc on Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, and how much worse things could get.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future","Polar caps quickly
losing ice. Chalky coral reefs. Stronger storms that devastate islands and
cities, claiming lives and destroying homes. Those aren’t
speculations about what our world faces in a warmer future. Those are climate
change impacts happening now — and set to worsen, according to a new report by
the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The report, a summary of which was released on September 25, is the panel’s first comprehensive update on how human-driven climate change is upsetting Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, or cryosphere. Just how severe things get will depend on whether countries rein in climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, or continue pumping them into the atmosphere.  The report focuses
on forecasts for two potential scenarios: One involves curbing carbon emissions
to limit global warming to around 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
(The world is already more than halfway there, having warmed by 1.1 degrees C since 1900, according to a report by the World
Meteorological Organization published September 22.) In another, high-emissions
scenario, pollution continues apace, potentially warming the world by about 4
degrees C.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Science News took a look at the report’s predictions for how changes to
Earth’s oceans and ice will impact societies and our natural world, along with
the latest science on where things stand today.  Already, glaciers and ice sheets are
shrinking, and some are shrinking fast. The Greenland ice sheet lost an average
278 billion tons of ice per year from 2006 to 2015. That amount of water alone is
enough to cause average global sea levels to rise about 0.77 millimeters per
year. And on July 31, a record-breaking 57 percent of the sheet showed signs of melting (SN: 8/2/19). Meanwhile, the Antarctic ice
sheet lost an average 155 billion tons per year, or roughly enough to raise
seas by an average 0.43 millimeters per year (SN: 6/13/18).  Glaciers from the Himalayas to Chile and Canada on average have lost 220 billion
tons per year (SN: 4/6/15),
threatening the safety and livelihoods of millions of people who rely on melt water to meet
their water needs (SN:
6/19/19). Greenland and Antarctica have dominated ice
melt contributing to rising sea levels. Even with global action against climate
change, the two massive ice sheets are still expected to contribute a combined
11 centimeters or so of sea level rise by 2100. But without that effort, average
sea levels could rise up to some 27 centimeters by 2100 just from the melting
in Greenland and Antarctica, the IPCC report says.  Glaciers could add nine to 20 centimeters to
that rise, depending on emissions. And regions with mostly smaller glaciers, like
Central Europe, Scandinavia and the Andes, could lose more than 80 percent of
their current ice mass by the end of the century if emissions continue business-as-usual. Glacier
runoff, regardless of emissions scenarios, would peak by the end of the century
and then decline, potentially leaving less water available for future generations.
 Aside from the ice that sits atop mountains
and landmasses, thick ice blankets the Arctic Sea, with more expansive coverage
in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter. Scientists say the white ice plays an
important role in reflecting sunlight away from Earth, which keeps the Arctic
from getting too hot. But that ice is
shrinking. Although the sea ice
expands and contracts over the course of a year, the overall amount of ice has
steadily declined since 1979, the IPCC
says.  So much melting has left little ice that has
endured for at least five years (such hardened ice is expected to be sturdier
than single-season ice). In fact, as of last year, the fraction of sea ice
older than five years had declined by about 90 percent since 1979, the report
says. In Antarctica, meanwhile, there’s still a lot
of uncertainty about the state of sea ice now and in the future (SN: 6/27/17).  The lid of sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean (which expands in the winter and contracts in the summer) has been steadily shrinking, satellite records show. The 2019 minimum extent, reached September 18, is tied with two other years for the second lowest amount of ice cover: 4.15 million square kilometers. In a low-emissions scenario that limits global
warming to 1.5 degrees C, the probability of September being ice free after the
summertime melt is a mere 1 percent. But at 2 degree C warming, that risk jumps
to 10 to 35 percent. The loss of sea ice takes away habitat for Arctic mammals
and birds. And less ice also means more exposed water, which is dark and
absorbs more sunshine.  Permanently frozen soil, which has carbon trapped
in the ground, is warming to record levels, increasing an average of 0.29
degrees Celsius from 2007 to 2016, the IPCC says. Arctic and other northern permafrost
is estimated to contain almost twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere. A
thaw in permafrost could release trapped carbon dioxide and methane into the air
— though it’s not yet certain if that’s
happening today (SN: 12/19/16).  But thaw it will, the report says. By 2100,
the expanse of Earth’s permafrost could decrease by around 24 percent in a
low-emissions scenario, or 69 percent in a high-emissions future. Under that
scenario, permafrost could exhale tens to hundreds of billions of tons of
carbon, in the form of CO2 and methane, into the atmosphere by 2100,
possibly making global warming even worse. Thawed regions might see more plant
growth, pulling some of that carbon back into the soil — but not nearly enough
to make up for carbon releases. So far, oceans have swallowed up
more than 90 percent of the climate’s excess heat, and as a result have been
warming up. Marine heat waves, which scorch coral reefs (SN: 1/4/18) and help boost the frequency of toxic algal blooms (SN: 8/28/18), are getting more severe and lasting longer
than they did decades ago (SN: 4/10/18).
And human-caused climate change may have been responsible for nearly 90 percent
of these events between 2006 and 2015, the IPCC says.  Those hot waters — which will get even hotter
under any emissions scenario — are also helping to drive many ocean-dwelling
animals to move toward cooler digs near the poles (SN: 5/2/18). But in
new environments, migrant animals can interfere with local food webs (SN: 2/2/15). Climate-driven shifts in ocean species may have already hurt overall catch potential for
the world’s fisheries (SN: 2/28/19). By 2100, ocean surfaces are expected to absorb
five to seven times more heat than they have since 1970 under a high-emissions
scenario. And heat waves would be 50 times more frequent than they were in 1900.
In a low-emissions scenario, heat waves would be 20 times more frequent by 2100
than in 1900.   It’s not just heat that oceans take in. The
world’s biggest water bodies also have absorbed an estimated 20 to 30 percent
of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere since the 1980s, causing
seawater to become more acidic (SN: 4/28/17). That’s going to continue, the IPCC says. In a high-emissions scenario, the pH of the ocean surface is expected to drop by around 0.3 pH points (on a scale of 14) by the end of the century. That acidity may make it more difficult for creatures like snails, crabs and shrimps to build their shells and impairs the function of tiny algae that ferry carbon to the deep ocean. Acidity can also deplete seawater of the minerals that corals use to build their exoskeletons (SN: 2/23/16).  Sea levels are rising faster with time. And that swell is going to continue under any emissions scenario, the IPCC says. From 2006 to 2015, sea level rose about  3.6 millimeters per year, about 2.5 times as fast as sea level rise from 1901 to 1990. Melting ice sheets and glaciers are primarily to blame. With higher sea levels come greater flooding and coastal
erosion. Encroaching seawater can also shrink habitats and force species along
coastlines to relocate — if they can. (SN:
8/6/19). Nearly half of coastal wetlands already have
disappeared over the last century, due partly to higher seawater.  In a low-emissions future, sea level rise
could reach an average 4 millimeters per year in 2100, compared with 15
millimeters per year in a high-emissions future. Higher sea levels are also
affecting the risk of certain disasters, such as coastal flooding. Extreme
events related to high seas that were once rare — happening once a century — could
happen at least once per year in many places by 2050, especially in the
tropics. That puts coastal areas and small islands
in even greater danger (SN: 8/15/18).  Human-driven climate change has likely increased
the amount of wind and rain associated with some tropical cyclones already (SN: 9/13/18).
These storms will probably get more intense, with bigger storm surges and more
rainfall, even if emissions are limited. Scientists aren’t yet sure whether
tropical cyclones will become more frequent, though.  What could become more frequent, and possibly less predicable (SN: 8/21/19), are extreme El Niño and La Niña events (SN: 1/26/15). Extreme El Niños may hit twice as often in this century compared with the last, the report says. These weather disturbances are also expected to become more hazardous, causing dryer droughts and more torrential downpours around the world. "
"498","IPCC report warns of a bleak future for oceans and frozen regions under climate change","A new IPCC report offers dire warnings about how climate change is altering oceans, the polar regions and the high snowy mountains.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-report-climate-change-bleak-future-oceans-cryosphere-solutions","Earth’s oceans and frozen regions are changing alarmingly quickly, scientists warn in the first comprehensive look at how greenhouse gas emissions are altering the planet’s seas and cryosphere.  Since 1993, the rate of
warming in the oceans has more than doubled, scientists report in a new study
by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Melting of the
two great ice sheets blanketing Greenland and West Antarctica is speeding up as
well, accelerating sea level rise. And West Antarctica’s glaciers may already
be so unstable that they are past the point of no return. “The consequences for nature
and humanity are sweeping and severe,” Ko Barrett, IPCC vice-chair and head of
research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said at a news
conference September 24. Rising seas are already threatening low-lying coastal
areas that today are home to 680 million people, about 10 percent of the
world’s population.   The Sept. 25 release of a summary
of the report coincided with the U.N.
Climate Action Summit in New York City. And it came amidst a surge of global
protests, climate strikes and calls for nations around the world to
dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions in hopes of limiting future warming.
 Such action can’t come too soon, scientists say. Already, warming ocean waters are yielding fewer fish (SN: 2/28/19), and are fueling more intense, rainier tropical storms (SN: 9/28/18). Ocean heat waves are increasing, threatening corals and other sea life (SN: 4/10/18). Greenland (SN: 9/18/19) and the West Antarctic ice sheet (SN: 8/5/19) are rapidly shedding ice, accelerating sea level rise to a rate of 3.5 millimeters per year. And Arctic sea ice continues to dwindle (SN: 3/14/19); minimum sea-ice extent in 2019 tied with 2007 and 2016, according to data released by the National Snow and Ice Data Center on September 23. That’s the second-lowest extent on satellite record, after 2012. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox “The ocean has largely been
left out of the discussion on climate,” says Becca Gisclair, senior director of
Arctic Programs for the Ocean Conservancy in Bellingham, Wash., who was not
involved in the IPCC study. The new report emphasizes the need to “slash
emissions, and do it quickly, or these impacts highlighted in the report will
quickly become irreversible…. My hope is that seeing all of these impacts in
one place can highlight the need for action.” The extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean reached its minimum for the year — 4.15 million square kilometers — on September 18, tying for the second lowest minimum in the satellite record with 2007 and 2016. The lowest measured sea ice extent was in 2012. The report is one of several
special reports focusing on the latest science on specific aspects of climate
change that the IPCC releases in between its large, sweeping assessments. Since
the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report came out in 2013, scientists have learned a
great deal about the impacts of absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide on the
oceans and their denizens, as well as in coastal areas, says Sarah Cooley,
director of the Ocean Conservancy’s ocean acidification program in Washington,
D.C. For this new report, 104 scientists from 36 countries evaluated 6,981
studies to determine the impact on the world’s oceans and ice-covered regions.  While the IPCC report rings
an alarm bell, there is hope, says climate scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, who
heads the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia.
The ocean isn’t just part of the problem, Hoegh-Guldberg says — it should be a
key part of the solution. “What’s surprising is how quickly we can limit the
damage,” Hoegh-Guldberg says, a message that he says was also embedded within the
IPCC’s 2018 special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius of
warming, for which he was a
contributing author (SN: 12/17/18).  Hoegh-Guldberg and
colleagues recently assessed ways to harness ocean resources to reduce or
mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. The study, commissioned by a group of
15 world leaders called the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, was released September 23 by the World Resources
Institute. In it, the researchers highlight five ocean-related activities that they say can help slow warming: Those five activities have the potential to account for as much as 21 percent of the emissions reductions needed by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times by the end of the century, Hoegh-Guldberg and colleagues write in the Sept. 27 Science. That help is sorely needed. Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1.1 degrees C, and studies suggest that global emissions are now on track to blow past midcentury targets needed to achieve 1.5 degrees (SN: 7/1/19).   Taken together, the two new
studies provide “a nice point-counterpoint,” says Jane Lubchenco, a marine
biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Lubchenco, who ran NOAA from
2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, is a co-chair of the High Level
Panel’s expert group of researchers and policy analysts. The IPCC special
report “shines a very bright spotlight on the ocean as a victim,” Lubchenco
says. “But it is also a powerful source of solutions.”  None of these potential
solutions are new concepts, but there has been little political will to invest
in the necessary research and development to move them forward, Hoegh-Guldberg says.
These actions may finally get some traction in December, when nations head to
Santiago, Chile, for COP25, the annual meeting to review progress of the U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change.  At the COP21 meeting in Paris in December 2015, 195 nations signed on to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, pledging to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep global warming to “well below” 2 degrees C above preindustrial times (SN: 12/12/15). The United States was one of the signing nations, but President Donald Trump has said he plans to withdraw the country from the accord in 2020 (SN: 6/1/17). Chile President Sebastián
Piñera has said COP25 will be the “Blue COP,” emphasizing the central role that
he expects ocean economies to play in the discussions. The U.N. climate meeting
in December is also a prelude to a 2020 deadline for Paris Agreement
signatories to submit revised and increasingly ambitious plans to reduce their
emissions.  Ocean-based mitigation
solutions could become a big part of those plans, Gisclair says. “There is a
big opportunity there for countries to make new climate commitments that
include the ocean.”"

The world’s existing power plants, industrial equipment, vehicles and other CO2-emitters are on track to pump out enough carbon dioxide by midcentury to blow past that target, researchers report July 1 in Nature.  Add in future power plants that are already planned, permitted or under construction, and we could emit enough by 2033 to raise average global atmospheric temperatures by 1.5 degrees, the researchers say.   If we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, then “we cannot invest more in fossil fuel power or infrastructure,” says Thorsten Mauritsen, a physical climate scientist at Stockholm University who was not involved with the work. “Everything we do from now has to change direction and not use fossil fuels.” In the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly all the world’s nations agreed to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit warming to “well below” 2 degrees by 2100 (SN: 1/9/16, p. 6). The United States has said it would pull out of the agreement (SN Online: 6/1/17), though the exit wouldn’t be complete until 2020. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Still, calls have increased since 2015 for the more ambitious goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees. That would mean fewer heat waves, spells of extreme weather and species extinctions (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7). Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1 degree. Emitting an additional 420 to 580 gigatons of CO2 could warm the planet to 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in 2018. Current infrastructure could emit that much CO2 between 2018 and as early as 2035, though it could take until 2046 to reach those totals, the new study found. Existing infrastructure, over its expected lifetime, would emit about 658 gigatons of CO2, say Steven Davis, an earth systems scientist at the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues. About 41 percent of those emissions would come from China, 9 percent from the United States and 7 percent from the European Union. Those expected global emissions rise to about 850 gigatons when proposed power plants are included. That’s enough to hit the 1.5 degree budget by 2033, and makes up roughly two-thirds of the 1,170 to 1,500 gigatons of CO2 to reach 2 degrees of warming. “This analysis … lends some concrete context to what a 1.5 degree target would mean,” Davis says. “These targets that get bandied about are very ambitious” and will require more than a few solar power projects and incremental emissions reductions, he says. Nearly 10 years ago, Davis and some colleagues performed a census of CO2–emitting infrastructure. The new study updates that census to include all known CO2 sources at the end of 2018, including power plants and industrial emitters, such as cement kilns, as well as transportation sources such as airplanes and vehicles. The update also accounts for shifts in greenhouse gas emissions caused by things such as the U.S. natural gas boom and China’s burgeoning economy. The resulting calculation is how much CO2 is “committed” to be created, unless policy or technology triggers change. The calculations don’t consider current and future efforts to mitigate emissions, for example by expanding renewable energy sources. Nor do the results account for projected emissions increases in developing economies. This work also doesn’t consider other sectors, for instance agriculture, which contributes methane, a potent greenhouse gas, says Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London in England who was not involved with the work. Still, he says, the results should serve as a wake-up call.  “This should not be seen as a fatalistic prediction of what will happen,” Roelj says. But it’s a “strong call to ensure that we make choices that reduce the carbon impact of what is currently in the pipeline.” Editor’s note: This story was updated July 24, 2019, to clarify that the study found that, by midcentury, there would be enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to increase future temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, rather than warming reaching that benchmark midcentury."
"500","The Arctic is burning and Greenland is melting, thanks to record heat","A heat wave is melting Greenland’s ice and fueling blazes across the Arctic that are pumping record amounts of carbon dioxide into the air.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-burning-greenland-melting-thanks-record-heat","The Arctic is on fire. Record-breaking temperatures and strong winds are fueling an unprecedented number of wildfires across the region this summer. In Siberia alone, hundreds of wildfires captured by satellite images July 28 spanned about 3 million hectares of land. Across Alaska, as many as 400 wildfires were burning as of mid-July. And the heat is also melting Greenland’s ice at an alarming rate. The scale and intensity of the June 2019 wildfires are unparalleled in the 16 years that the European Union’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, or CAMS, has been tracking global wildfire data. And July’s numbers “have been of similar proportions,” says CAMS senior scientist Mark Parrington. “I’ve been surprised at the duration of the fires in the Arctic Circle, in particular.” Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Wildfires most often occur in the Arctic in July and August, sparked by lightning strikes. But this year, unusually hot and dry conditions in the Northern Hemisphere in June exacerbated the problem and drove the fire season’s start earlier, the World Meteorological Organization reported July 12. Unusually high temperatures and low precipitation in the region were almost certainly fueling the July wildfires as well, Parrington says. In early August, CAMS will release its monthly bulletin summarizing the July data, he adds, and “I wouldn’t be surprised if the July fires correspond to [those climate] anomalies.” In Alaska, a heat record toppled July 4, with temperatures reaching as high as 32.2° Celsius (90° Fahrenheit). Average June temperatures in parts of Siberia were almost 10 degrees higher than the average temperatures from 1981 to 2010. That same month, more than 100 intense wildfires were burning within the Arctic Circle. On August 1, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite took this image of western Greenland. To the left of the island’s ice sheet, an active wildfire burns. Meanwhile, abundant melt ponds (appearing as blue spots) collect on the ice itself, another effect of record temperatures.    Greenland is also sweltering in the Northern Hemisphere’s heat wave: The island lost nearly 200 billion tons of ice in July, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute. On July 31, a record-breaking 56.5 percent of Greenland’s ice sheet was showing signs of melting, DMI glaciologist Ruth Mottram told the Associated Press. Images from the Copernicus satellite captured August 1 show multiple melt ponds, as well as burn scars from a recent fire and smoke from an active fire on the island. The Arctic blazes are not only scorching vast swaths of Earth; they’re also releasing copious amounts of carbon dioxide. June’s fires alone released more than 50 metric megatons of carbon dioxide, the WMO said, more than the total released by all June fires from 2010 to 2018. Total CO2 emissions from the Arctic wildfires for July are estimated at about 79 megatons, Parrington says. That’s roughly double the emissions from the previous record-setting month: July 2004. That year also set a previous annual record, with total Arctic wildfire CO2 emissions of about 110 megatons. 2019 has already smashed that record. About 79 metric megatons of carbon dioxide were emitted by wildfires in the Arctic Circle in July 2019, smashing the previous record set in July 2004. Carbon dioxide emissions from wildfires in the Arctic in July, 2003–2019 Emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are responsible for the current era of global warming (SN: 8/3/19, p. 7). Human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases have already warmed the planet by 1 degree C above preindustrial times. Temperatures in the Arctic are increasing twice as fast as the global average, further promoting the growth and persistence of wildfires in the region. Such Arctic wildfires are expected to become more common as the planet warms. There’s geologic precedent for that: Layers of black charcoal in sediments in the Canadian Arctic suggest that wildfires frequently raged across the region during the Pliocene Epoch, when global atmospheric CO2 levels were between 350 and 450 parts per million — similar to today  (SN: 12/9/17, p. 24). In June, CO2 levels averaged 413.92 ppm, according to data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Meanwhile, increasingly frequent winter warm spells, insect outbreaks and wildfires have also caused many Arctic plants to lose their resistance to freezing, dry out and die, turning large parts of the Arctic brown (SN: 4/13/19, p. 16). That, in turn, increases the region’s susceptibility to more wildfires: Normally, the icy peatlands are soggy enough to be fire-resistant, but they are thawing and drying out. Once set ablaze, the carbon-rich peat can burn for months, releasing large amounts of CO2 back into the atmosphere and fueling the warming feedback loop (SN: 3/17/18, p. 20)."
"501","Warm, dry winds may be straining Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf","Wind-induced melting that occurred during the Antarctic autumn may be accelerating the Larsen C ice shelf’s collapse, which could raise sea levels.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-dry-winds-melting-antarctica-larsen-c-ice-shelf","Turquoise pools of snowmelt on the Antarctic Peninsula, including on the Larsen C ice shelf, have recently been forming months after the continent’s peak summer melt. Bursts of warm, dry wind cascading over mountains that run along the peninsula are largely to blame, researchers report April 11 in Geophysical Research Letters. In this March 2016 satellite image, meltwater on part of Larsen C can be seen at the foothills of these mountains, just one case of this type of wind-induced melting. Eastward-flowing winds sweeping across the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes pick up enough speed to surmount its mountain peaks. As the air rises and chills, its moisture condenses and, in the process, reheats the air. So when the now-dry air comes coursing down the leeway mountainside, it can be a balmy 20° Celsius. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Researchers “have told me they’ve been in a T-shirt” while standing in these winds, says cryospheric scientist Tri Datta of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.  Datta and her team compared satellite data collected from 1982 to 2017 with simulations of the peninsula’s ice sheet and atmospheric conditions during the same period. The team found that, since 2015, these winds called foehns have caused a lot of melting on the peninsula, including on Larsen C, as late as May, well into Antarctica’s autumn. Foehns likely cause 60 percent of the total snowmelt on the northeastern part of the peninsula at that time of year, Datta says. That’s a problem because meltwater can trickle into crevasses on Larsen C. The water’s own weight wedges the cracks open and may help cause the ice shelf to break off. Late melting can also prevent new snow from replenishing the ice shelf. In 2017, a giant iceberg broke from Larsen C, raising questions about the shelf’s stability and how it may contribute to rising seas (SN: 8/5/17, p. 6). It’s still unclear what’s driving these foehns and if they’re linked to climate change. And Datta emphasizes that three years is too short to constitute a trend. But without Larsen C, which buttresses multiple glaciers, glacial ice flow to the ocean could accelerate and contribute to rising global sea levels. "
"502","Mercury levels in fish are rising despite reduced emissions","Climate change and overfishing can increase how much mercury accumulates in fish, counteracting efforts to reduce human-caused emissions.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-levels-fish-are-rising-despite-reduced-emissions","Climate change and overfishing may be hampering efforts to reduce toxic mercury accumulations in the fish and shellfish that end up on our plates. Mercury emissions are decreasing around the globe. But new research suggests that warmer ocean waters and fishing’s effects on ecosystems can alter how much mercury builds up in seafood. Fishing practices increased methylmercury levels in the tissue of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) caught in the Gulf of Maine by as much as 23 percent over a roughly 30-year period, researchers estimate. That’s despite decreases in atmospheric mercury levels over the same time period, from the 1970s to the 2000s. The finding is based on simulations of mercury emissions as well as ecosystem changes related to fishing. It reveals how the diet of cod, driven by the rebound of once-overfished herring, plays an important role in determining how much mercury accumulates in the fish, the team reports online August 7 in Nature. The scientists also created simulations of the effects of warming seawater on mercury bioaccumulation, incorporating changing emissions and temperatures as well as mercury accumulations measured in Gulf of Maine Atlantic bluefin tuna since 1969. Those simulations suggest that seawater temperature increases could be responsible for as much as a 56 percent increase in methylmercury concentrations found in Gulf of Maine Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the team found. “This is really the first investigation to look at migratory marine fish and the potential impacts of temperature and overfishing” at the same time, says study coauthor Elsie Sunderland, an environmental chemist at Harvard University. Scientists have long assumed that when it comes to mercury piling up in seafood, the only factor that matters is how much is being sent into the sky, she says. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Simulations suggest that the level of methylmercury in Gulf of Maine seawater has decreased since the 1970s, thanks to more regulation of emissions from coal-fired power plants (below).  Methylmercury in Gulf of Maine seawater A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 But measured seawater temperatures are increasing around the globe, and the Gulf of Maine waters are warming particularly quickly relative to the global average (below).  Gulf of Maine temperature deviation from global average A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 Those effects impact how much mercury accumulates in Atlantic bluefin tuna caught in the region, simulations show (below). If emissions alone were considered, tuna mercury levels should follow the trend of the dotted line – first rising after the 1970s and then dropping off. But new research reveals that mercury levels in tuna depend on both emissions and water temperatures (solid line), with an early peak related to emissions and then a steady increase since about 2000 that corresponds to rising seawater temperatures.  Effect of water mercury levels and temperature on tuna A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 Emissions do matter, but are only one piece of the puzzle. Mercury emissions, as inorganic mercury, can come from both human activities such as burning coal or natural sources like volcanoes. Eventually, that mercury rains back down onto Earth’s surface. Microorganisms then convert the mercury into an organic form called methylmercury that can cling to organic matter. When tiny creatures consume that matter, the metal gets stored in their fatty tissues. And so on up the food chain: As increasingly larger animals eat methylmercury-laden dinners, more and more of the metal accumulates in the predators. In oceans, this toxic trek can go from zooplankton to small fish and crustaceans, then bigger fish and, finally, people. That accumulation can be deadly: Methylmercury poisoning can damage the central nervous and digestive systems, causing cognitive damage, kidney failure and death. The good news is that emissions are no longer on the rise. From 1990 to 2010, mercury emissions from human activities decreased from 2,890 megagrams per year to 2,280 megagrams per year. Emissions, particularly from the European Union and the United States, continue to decline, according to a global assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme. A 2017 global treaty to reduce emissions could lower those numbers further. In the United States, mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants dropped from about 41,700 kilograms in 2006 to about 6,300 kilograms in 2016, a decrease of 85 percent. That decrease is the direct result of state regulations on emissions and, later, a 2011 federal standard, Sunderland says. But, surprisingly, that hasn’t led to a straightforward decrease in the mercury measured in fish. Some fish in the Gulf of Maine, such as Atlantic cod, showed increases in mercury in their tissues over time, the team found. Others, including the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), showed decreases. To try to solve that mystery, biogeochemist Amina Schartup of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and colleagues zoomed in more closely on the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. The area has a long history of intense scrutiny, both as a historical fishing ground as a hot spot for global warming. Seawater temperatures there are among the fastest rising in the world. The team looked at methylmercury levels in seawater, sediments and across the ecosystem. The researchers also wanted to compare these data with changes in the diets of Atlantic cod and spiny dogfish through time. To do this, the team analyzed the stomach contents of the two species from the 1970s and 2000s, using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s extensive records on fish stocks in the region. Mercury differences between the two types of fish were directly related to diet changes resulting from humans’ fishing habits, the researchers found. Cod and dogfish both prefer to eat herring, but in the 1970s, herring populations in the region collapsed due to overfishing. So the cod turned to smaller herring, which have relatively lower mercury levels, and the dogfish turned to heavily mercury-laden squid. But then herring came back on the menu as its populations rebounded after the 1970s. Dogfish ate fewer squid, and their mercury increases slowed. Cod, on the other hand, saw a more dramatic increase in mercury accumulation. Seawater temperatures in the Gulf of Maine may also alter mercury accumulation. Using calculations of energy expenditure, growth and prey consumption for Atlantic bluefin tuna, the researchers estimated how much warming waters increase fish activity. More active fish consume more food and accumulate more mercury, which could explain higher than expected mercury levels measured in the fish given declining emissions, the scientists suggest.   Next, the team plans to expand these simulations beyond the Gulf of Maine, Sunderland says. “That’s really the goal,” she says. “To understand the changing impacts for all these ecosystems.” William Cheung, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, says another step will be to link these findings to public health, and to make projections for future seafood safety. “It’s a really important piece of work,” he says. “Historically, we’ve only looked at these problems individually: climate change, overfishing, contamination…. We may be underestimating the level of risk and impacts.” But efforts to project those risks going forward is a task made trickier by some uncertainty in future mercury emissions, particularly from the United States. In December 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed weakening its mercury regulations, suggesting that they are no longer “appropriate or necessary.” Yet those regulations “are a tremendous environmental success story,” Sunderland says. Rolling those regulations back could undo a lot of the good that they have done, she says. “The situation would be much worse without them.”"
"503","Ancient crystal growths in caves reveal seas rose 16 meters in a warmer world","The Pliocene era cave formations on the Spanish coast of Mallorca offer hints about how oceans could respond to human-driven climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-crystal-growth-caves-reveal-seas-rose-16-meters-warmer-world","The
future of sea level rise may be written into the walls of coastal Spanish caves. Mineral
“bathtub rings” deposited inside the limestone Artà Caves on
the Balearic island of Mallorca show how high seas rose during the
Pliocene Epoch — a time when Earth was
about as warm as it’s expected to get by 2100. Those mineral deposits suggest the
planet’s seas were
around 16 meters higher on average than they are today,
researchers report August 30 in Nature.
 That measurement provides the most precise peek yet
into what may come as climate change causes ice sheets to melt and ocean waters
to rise — a process that could happen
over hundreds to thousands of years. Previous estimates of Pliocene sea levels gave
similar results, but relied on more indirect dating methods or failed to
incorporate information about the subsequent rise and fall of the Earth’s
crust. The Artà analysis, however, takes that rise and fall into account.  The new study’s combination of precision dating and corrected
sea levels also may help answer a crucial question: How much of Earth’s biggest
ice sheet melted during the Pliocene? These sea level measurements suggest that,
while smaller ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica melted severely, only
the parts of the massive eastern Antarctic ice sheet that jutted into the sea
melted during that era, says Alan Haywood, a paleoclimatologist
at Leeds University in England who was not
involved in the study. It’s still unclear, however, how today’s unique warming
patterns will affect ice sheets. “Anything that gives us added information on how
sensitive the ice sheets are … is going to be very important,” Haywood says. Conditions during the Pliocene, 5.33 million to 2.58
million years ago, may offer the best example of what a human-addled
climate will eventually look like (SN:
11/28/17). In the past, paleoclimatologists mainly
used two approaches in reconstructing Pliocene sea level changes. One links ratios
of two types of oxygen, or isotopes, in fossilized sea creatures to a global
record of oxygen ratios and ice sheet cycles. The other uses the ages of ancient
coral reefs to estimate ancient sea levels. For the new study, researchers searched
caves for evidence of past sea level change (SN:
4/15/13). “Caves are a very protected environment,”
says study coauthor Oana-Alexandra Dumitru, a geochemist at the University of South Florida in Tampa who began
collaborating with Mallorcan researchers as a
graduate student. “We don’t worry about erosion and other weathering after
deposition as much as you would about terrestrial or other records.”  In the 1970s, Mallorcan researchers found aragonite and calcite deposits on stalactites and
stalagmites in the Artà Caves. The deposits, called phreatic overgrowths,
accumulate over years when brackish seawater laps against the rock. Similar features
have been found in coastal caves on the Italian island of Sardinia and in Mexico
and Japan. Early dating attempts in the 1990s and 2000s focused on samples only
a few hundreds of thousands of years old. But Dumitru and colleagues used a
dating method capable of reaching back further in time, comparing ratios of
uranium to lead in the minerals, to determine when the much older Pliocene deposits
formed. As Earth’s temperatures rose, higher levels of seawater
washed into the caves. That rising water left behind mineral deposits at
heights from 14.7 to 23.5 meters above today’s sea level, Dumitru’s team found.
 One of the lower deposits corresponds with the mid-Piacenzian
Warm Period, which lasted from about 3.3 million to 3 million years ago. Global
temperatures during that time period were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius warmer than in
modern, preindustrial times —
and resemble leading forecasts for the year 2100. Global mean sea levels then were
16.2 meters higher than today, Dumitru and colleagues calculate.  The higher of the six mineral deposits studied corresponds to the Pliocene’s warmest period about 4.39 million years ago, when temperatures were about 4 degrees C higher than in preindustrial times. That Artà sample suggests that seas were about 23.5 meters higher than today. “We still may not know exactly how much sea level rose,” Haywood says. But with results like these, “we’re getting more confidence that we’re in the right ballpark.”  "

As a result, foodborne Campylobacter infections could increase with climate change, proposes epidemiologist Melanie Cousins of the University of Waterloo in Canada.  Cousins’ computer simulation, still a proof-of-concept version, focuses on how the warm weather surge in house flies and their activity affects the typical spring-summer rise in Campylobacter cases. Under a scenario of summers 2.5 degrees Celsius warmer on average than in 2003, the simulation predicts about 28 percent more Campylobacter cases in the Canadian province of Ontario by 2050, she and colleagues say February 13 in Royal Society Open Science. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Campylobacter infections are most often caused by contaminated food, perhaps by a fly that’s strolled on other tainted food, an infected animal or feces. Most people recover from an infection within about 10 days. The bacteria are the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness in Canada, with Ontario averaging more than 3,000 cases a year. The United States has some 1.3 million infections a year. To set up a simplified simulation, Cousins used data from 2005 on reported Campylobacter infections in Ontario to estimate transmission rates and fly birth and death rates. She then plugged those rates into the simulation to predict subsequent years’ Campylobacter infections. Those results came close to the real data available through 2013, and allowed her to predict future infections under different warming scenarios. The simulation assumes flies become more active with climate change since, like other insects, they depend on ambient temperatures for heating and cooling. It also assumes bacterial increases with warming. The study is just the latest to highlight consequences of warming on insect behavior. Other studies have predicted how climate change might increase pest attacks on crops (SN: 9/29/18, p. 8) and affect public health, such as Lyme disease’s creep into Canada (SN: 8/19/17, p. 16)."

Today we know it was just a blip, and that Earth’s climate is warming thanks to industrial activity over the last century.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-puzzled-over-slight-global-cooling","Earth’s cooling climate, Science News, November 15, 1969 — The average temperature for the entire Earth rose gradually from the 1880s until the early 1940s. At that time, a cooling trend suddenly set in which is continuing today.… The amount of dust and other particulate matter in the atmosphere has increased dramatically in recent decades, a change that could counteract the thermal effect of carbon dioxide buildup. From 1940 to about 1975, the average global surface temperature decreased by about 0.1 degrees Celsius, interrupting a decades-long warming trend even as carbon emissions continued to rise. Many scientists thought the cooling trend was possibly caused by sulfate particles from the burning of fossil fuels that can scatter sunlight and reduce atmospheric warming (SN: 11/21/09, p. 5). That hunch proved correct: When the United States and other countries began to lower sulfur emissions in the 1970s to reduce acid rain and respiratory illnesses, the cooling ended abruptly. Since 1975, the average global temperature has risen by about 0.6 degrees C. Today, the average surface temperature is 1.1 degrees C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times (SN: 9/25/19). However, ongoing sulfate emissions, particularly from China and India, may still be slowing greenhouse gas-driven warming. Removing all aerosol emissions from the world at once could add about 0.7 degrees C to global temperatures. "
"506","Why this warmer world is not just a passing phase","Editor in Chief Nancy Shute discusses climate change and the uncertainty of science.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-warmer-world-not-just-passing-phase","In the late 1990s, three scientists published a paper charting the Earth’s temperatures over the last millennium. For the first 900 years, the trend line was the definition of boring: just little blips up and down. That changed around 1900, when the mean global temperature shot up, and kept rising. That now-famous trend line, dubbed “the hockey stick” because of its sharp upward slope, is so vivid that it has played a key role in two decades of argument over whether the Earth’s atmosphere is warming, and whether those changes are caused by heat-trapping gases generated by human activities.  It’s not hard to pick apart a single study’s data. Critics of the hockey stick pointed to centuries-long temperature shifts such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age to argue that anomalies in the 20th century were also short-term, natural shifts. Critics also noted the patchwork nature of the pre-1900 data, which didn’t rely on direct measurements, and said there was no direct evidence that increased greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels was causing the current temperature rise. Uncertainty is central to the enterprise of science. It’s a rare day when a single study — or dozens, or hundreds — answers a question without a doubt. And because uncertainty almost always remains, scientists have to explain both quantitatively and qualitatively how uncertain they are. That’s good science. But climate change naysayers used that uncertainty to say, “The scientists aren’t sure.” And it meant that when we journalists reported accurately on the science by noting uncertainty, we gave more ammunition to doubters. Well, scientists are now sure. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international consortium convened by the United Nations to evaluate the science of climate, released a report saying there was greater than 95 percent certainty that the substantial warming was due to human activities. And scientists are increasingly linking extreme weather events worldwide, from heat waves to hurricanes, to human-caused climate change (SN: 1/19/19, p. 7). In this issue, we report on how the city of Boston is regularly flooding due to rising sea levels. Freelancer Mary Caperton Morton explains how policy makers and scientists are racing to develop responses to keep the venerable city functioning as the water moves inland. And earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling reports on a startling new study that lays to rest the argument that the warming we’re experiencing is just another normal climate shift. This one is clearly different, the data show: Those earlier temperature fluctuations were regional; what’s happening now is worldwide.  Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State who is one of the researchers who developed the hockey stick data chart, said back in 2005 that he thought that people wouldn’t take climate change seriously until they saw it in their own backyards. People in Boston think they’re seeing it, as do people in many other communities around the world who are bracing for more extreme heat, rainfall, drought and storms. Our charge at Science News is to continue to report on the science while chronicling humankind’s responses, for good or ill. "
"507","Is climate change causing Europe’s intense heat? A scientist weighs in","Science News talks with climate scientist Karsten Haustein about attributing extreme heat events in Europe and South Asia to climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-heat-wave","Mainland Europe has sweltered for days under record-breaking temperatures, prompting researchers to try to untangle how much of the heat wave can be linked to climate change. A report on that, by an international consortium of scientists called the World Weather Attribution Network, is expected to be released on July 2. Previous heat records for many parts of Europe were set in the summer of 2003, when temperatures soared to 44.1° Celsius (111.4° Fahrenheit) in the southern French town of Conqueyrac. That extreme heat killed more than 70,000 people across the continent — a death toll  that researchers determined was amplified by climate change (SN: 9/3/16, p. 5). Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox As another heat wave in 2018 baked Europe for three months, the consortium conducted a rapid assessment that determined it could not have happened without anthropogenic, or human-caused, climate change. Such events could occur yearly if global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the researchers found. If global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, though, such events were predicted every two out of three years. This year’s event, which began in mid-June, is expected to be shorter. But it is intense. On June 28, temperatures in Gallargues-le-Montueux, a city in southern France, hit 45.9° C (114.6° F), smashing temperature records for the country. But Europe isn’t the only part of the world dealing with dangerous heat levels. India and Pakistan have been suffering since mid-May under one of the longest-lasting heat waves in its recent history. In June, temperatures in New Delhi soared to 48° C (118.4° F), the highest ever recorded for the month in the Indian capital. By June 21, at least 180 people reportedly had died from heat-related causes. Science News spoke with Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford in England who is affiliated with the consortium, about what’s behind these deadly events and how scientists determine in real time whether a particular heat wave can be attributed to climate change. His comments have been edited for clarity and brevity. SN: Why was the World Weather Attribution Network created? Haustein: The idea was that we would look at any given extreme events while they’re happening and try to scientifically attribute the climate change factor. For example, has it become a more likely event or not [due to climate change]? We define the event, put it into historic context — for example, is it a 1-in-100-year event? — and determine if it’s setting records or getting media attention. And then we do the model analyses to isolate the climate signal. We’re also teaching other researchers, in places including Kenya, South Africa and Australia, how to use our methods. SN: Why are you analyzing the current Europe heat wave? Haustein: This current heat wave just started 10 days ago. [By June 24], it was already shaping up to be pretty extreme, so we went for it. The all-time maximum temperature in France was 44.1° C, from August 2003. That was a really bad one. There are chances we’ll get up to 45° C, which would be quite a new record. [A few hours after this interview, that milestone was reached on June 28.] For June, that’s pretty epic. Germany’s temperatures will peak on Sunday [June 30], and probably Monday [July 1] in Austria. And then there are two cold fronts that will be pushing through. SN: What atmospheric conditions are causing the intense heat? Haustein: To get a heat wave going, you need warm air in the upper level [of the atmosphere]. That comes from the south, from Africa. We actually set a record [on June 27] for temperatures at 1.5 kilometers above Earth’s surface, reaching 25.5° C. How those upper-level air masses translate into temperatures on the surface is a different story. In simple terms, the jet stream where it sits across Europe divides colder air in the north from warmer air in the south. Sometimes [this fast current of air above the Northern Hemisphere] becomes very wiggly, with big loops going far to the north and all the way down to northern Africa. That can transport really hot air from Africa to Europe. If it sits over Europe for several days, it can heat the surface. What’s causing that wiggly jet stream is contentious. Some people have suggested it’s linked to increasing temperatures in the Arctic. But we don’t really know. All we can say is that, over the last 10 days, there’s been a tendency to have this pattern: We see the jet stream digging farther south, and Europe is sitting in this warm air. Extreme temperatures scorched much of India and Pakistan from mid-May through June 2019. NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System, a global atmospheric climate simulation, created this map of air temperatures across the region on June 10. Several factors contributed to the heat wave, including a delayed monsoon. The health impacts of South Asia’s rising temperatures are unclear, though, due to other factors that can impact health, including higher humidity and air pollution levels in the region. And it’s also not yet clear if the region has been seeing an overall trend of increasing maximum air temperatures since the 1970s. NASA Earth Observatory SN: What about the heat wave in South Asia?  Haustein: As far as climate attribution, it’s similar to work we did on the 2016 heat wave in India. [That heat wave included a record-breaking temperature of 51° C in the western state of Rajasthan.] India’s 2019 temperatures appear to be due to natural year-to-year variability. We did a brief analysis that found that maximum temperatures across India in the hottest months aren’t clearly increasing. SN: What did the consortium learn in analyzing the 2018 European heat wave? Haustein: We know that the frequency and intensity of heat waves are increasing globally. Heat waves in Europe, such as the one in 2018, are at least twice as likely to occur now as a result of climate change."
"508","How today’s global warming is unlike the last 2,000 years of climate shifts","Temperatures at the end of the 20th century were hotter almost everywhere on the planet than in the previous two millennia.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-today-unlike-last-2000-years-climate-shifts","Temperatures across 98 percent of Earth’s surface were hotter at the end of the 20th century than at any time in the previous 2,000 years. Such nearly universal warming, occurring in lockstep across the planet, is unique to this current era, scientists say. By contrast, other well-known cold and warm snaps of the past, such as the Little Ice Age or the Medieval Warm Period, were, in fact, regional rather than worldwide. What’s more, the rate at which temperatures are increasing now far exceeds any previous temperature fluctuations measured in the last two millennia. Those are the conclusions of a trio of new papers examining temperature trends over the last 2,000 years, published online July 24 in Nature and Nature Geoscience. Those previous climate fluctuations were primarily driven by natural causes, including powerful volcanic eruptions, rather than human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.   Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The findings, which are based on newly available global paleoclimate data, reinforce an inescapable conclusion, says Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University who was not involved in the new studies: “The current period of warmth is unprecedented in its global scope in the last 2,000 years.” In the Nature study, a team led by Raphael Neukom, a climate scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, used many different types of temperature records from around the world to create thousands of climate reconstructions of the last two millennia, from A.D. 1 to 2000. Those data were collected by an international group of scientists called the PAGES 2k Consortium. They include proxies for temperatures derived from tree rings, glacier ice cores, lake and ocean sediments, cave deposits such as stalactites and stalagmites and historical documents (SN: 10/28/17, p. 29). Using those data, as well as direct temperature measurements collected in some locations since the 1800s and some climate simulations, the team produced more than 15,000 different climate reconstructions of past global temperatures. Then, the researchers took a close look at the precise timing of warming or cooling within four previously identified “climate epochs” — the Roman Warm Period from about A.D. 1 to 300, the Dark Ages Cold Period from 400 to 800, the Medieval Warm Period from about 800 to 1200 and the Little Ice Age from 1300 to 1850. Well-known climate fluctuations of the last 2,000 years were once thought to be global. But research using newly available temperature proxy data from around the planet reveals that these fluctuations were regional. In each map, different colors represent the warmest (or coldest) century for a given location within the represented time period. For example, the Dark Ages Cold Period is thought to span from about A.D. 400 to 800. But colder temperatures occurred several hundred years earlier in the Pacific Ocean (white to pale purple) and several hundred years later in East Asia and other locations (darker purple). Similarly, the Medieval Warm Period (or Medieval Climate Anomaly) lasted roughly from 800 to 1200, with peak warmth occurring during the 11th century in northwestern Europe (orange). But central South America saw peak warmth several hundred years later (brown). Across all 2,000 years included in the new research, however, temperatures were hottest at the end of the 20th century for 98 percent of the planet (shown in the third map). Cold and warm snaps of the past were regional, unlike current global warming Although the same datasets were input into the climate reproductions, the team used different methodologies, varying widely in computational complexity, to process the data and calculate past temperatures. Regardless of which method was used, the story was the same, the researchers found: Those past climate epochs were not simultaneous, global events. The Little Ice Age, for example, was a cold snap thought to have lasted from roughly 1350 to 1850. But the deep freezes didn’t occur everywhere at the same time, the new analysis shows. Northwestern Europe and southeastern North America got their coldest temperatures during the 17th century, while the area encompassing the central and eastern Pacific Ocean were coldest two hundred years earlier, during the 15th century, the team found. The Medieval Warm Period, also called the Medieval Climate Anomaly, showed the warmest temperatures in northwestern Europe and eastern North America during the 11th century. But peak warmth occurred several hundred years later in central South America, and several hundred years earlier in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. “The traditional understanding is that these [climate epochs, like the Little Ice Age] were global-scale phenomena,” says Nathan Steiger, a climate scientist at Columbia University. “That’s not the case.” That finding stands in stark contrast to the team’s conclusions about the current era of warming: It is occurring concurrently around the globe, with the hottest temperatures in the study found to be right at the end of the 20th century. “It is coherent in a way we didn’t experience over the last 2,000 years,” Steiger says. Because the study’s temperature data go only to 2000, the last two decades of temperatures weren’t included. But NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported in February that nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the last five years were the five hottest on record (SN Online: 2/6/19). Human activities have been repeatedly cited by scientists as the cause of these ongoing record-breaking temperatures (SN Online: 7/2/19). At a news conference on July 22, Steiger noted that the Nature study didn’t specifically mention that the current warming is due to anthropogenic activities, in part because so many previous studies have repeatedly and clearly demonstrated that link. “We don’t need to look at paleoclimate to know that.” A second study, published in Nature Geoscience, does address the question of anthropogenic warming more explicitly. The study, authored by Neukom and other members of the PAGES 2k Consortium, used the same temperature proxies as the Nature study. But instead of comparing spatial patterns of warming and cooling around the globe, the team looked at the average global temperature through time. That, Neukom said at the news conference, revealed that the current rate of warming is much faster than anything observed in the last 2,000 years that can be attributed to natural variability. “It’s another angle to look at the extraordinary nature of current warming,” he said. A third study, also in Nature Geoscience, added another layer of context to the trends, by looking at what natural forces may have been behind large regional temperature fluctuations such as the Little Ice Age. Led by University of Bern climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann, the researchers found that before the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1800s, powerful volcanic eruptions were the main engine behind such large-scale temperature fluctuations. For instance, five powerful eruptions, including the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, occurred toward the end of the Little Ice Age, which began around 1350 and ended around 1850 (SN: 7/7/18, p. 32). The eruptions initially led to cooling and climate upheaval, and then a period of recovery as the planet warmed up again. That recovery coincides with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, at which point greenhouse gases became the primary driver for warming, the researchers note. Mann notes that the studies’ findings — that these past climate epochs weren’t global and that current warming is proceeding at an unprecedented rate — aren’t exactly new ideas. In 1998, he and colleagues published a famous study in Nature, sometimes referred to as the “hockey stick” paper, that revealed a dramatic upward tick in temperatures at the end of the 20th century — a pattern that, when plotted through time, takes the shape of a hockey stick. “It’s gratifying that independent, international teams using entirely different approaches have come to virtually identical conclusions,” Mann says. Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who coauthored the hockey stick study, agrees. “In that paper, we were widely criticized for saying the last decade was the warmest in the last 1,000 years,” he says. Bradley adds that the new studies are a valuable addition, with a “high quality, carefully screened set of data” as well as powerful simulations that can synthesize and reproduce those past temperatures. “They’ve done everything right,” he adds. But the PAGES 2k database of temperature proxies still contains some glaring holes, particularly in tropical regions and in the oceans. Such data won’t change the underlying storyline, but could help scientists see global temperature fluctuations even more clearly, Bradley says. Efforts to collect more temperature data from South America are already afoot, from cave formations across Brazil and Argentina as well as from ancient trees in the Amazon forest, he adds, and “that’s exactly what’s needed.”"
"509","How climate change is already altering oceans and ice, and what’s to come","A new IPCC report gives the lowdown on how climate change is already wreaking havoc on Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, and how much worse things could get.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future","Polar caps quickly
losing ice. Chalky coral reefs. Stronger storms that devastate islands and
cities, claiming lives and destroying homes. Those aren’t
speculations about what our world faces in a warmer future. Those are climate
change impacts happening now — and set to worsen, according to a new report by
the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The report, a summary of which was released on September 25, is the panel’s first comprehensive update on how human-driven climate change is upsetting Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, or cryosphere. Just how severe things get will depend on whether countries rein in climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, or continue pumping them into the atmosphere.  The report focuses
on forecasts for two potential scenarios: One involves curbing carbon emissions
to limit global warming to around 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
(The world is already more than halfway there, having warmed by 1.1 degrees C since 1900, according to a report by the World
Meteorological Organization published September 22.) In another, high-emissions
scenario, pollution continues apace, potentially warming the world by about 4
degrees C.  Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Science News took a look at the report’s predictions for how changes to
Earth’s oceans and ice will impact societies and our natural world, along with
the latest science on where things stand today.  Already, glaciers and ice sheets are
shrinking, and some are shrinking fast. The Greenland ice sheet lost an average
278 billion tons of ice per year from 2006 to 2015. That amount of water alone is
enough to cause average global sea levels to rise about 0.77 millimeters per
year. And on July 31, a record-breaking 57 percent of the sheet showed signs of melting (SN: 8/2/19). Meanwhile, the Antarctic ice
sheet lost an average 155 billion tons per year, or roughly enough to raise
seas by an average 0.43 millimeters per year (SN: 6/13/18).  Glaciers from the Himalayas to Chile and Canada on average have lost 220 billion
tons per year (SN: 4/6/15),
threatening the safety and livelihoods of millions of people who rely on melt water to meet
their water needs (SN:
6/19/19). Greenland and Antarctica have dominated ice
melt contributing to rising sea levels. Even with global action against climate
change, the two massive ice sheets are still expected to contribute a combined
11 centimeters or so of sea level rise by 2100. But without that effort, average
sea levels could rise up to some 27 centimeters by 2100 just from the melting
in Greenland and Antarctica, the IPCC report says.  Glaciers could add nine to 20 centimeters to
that rise, depending on emissions. And regions with mostly smaller glaciers, like
Central Europe, Scandinavia and the Andes, could lose more than 80 percent of
their current ice mass by the end of the century if emissions continue business-as-usual. Glacier
runoff, regardless of emissions scenarios, would peak by the end of the century
and then decline, potentially leaving less water available for future generations.
 Aside from the ice that sits atop mountains
and landmasses, thick ice blankets the Arctic Sea, with more expansive coverage
in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter. Scientists say the white ice plays an
important role in reflecting sunlight away from Earth, which keeps the Arctic
from getting too hot. But that ice is
shrinking. Although the sea ice
expands and contracts over the course of a year, the overall amount of ice has
steadily declined since 1979, the IPCC
says.  So much melting has left little ice that has
endured for at least five years (such hardened ice is expected to be sturdier
than single-season ice). In fact, as of last year, the fraction of sea ice
older than five years had declined by about 90 percent since 1979, the report
says. In Antarctica, meanwhile, there’s still a lot
of uncertainty about the state of sea ice now and in the future (SN: 6/27/17).  The lid of sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean (which expands in the winter and contracts in the summer) has been steadily shrinking, satellite records show. The 2019 minimum extent, reached September 18, is tied with two other years for the second lowest amount of ice cover: 4.15 million square kilometers. In a low-emissions scenario that limits global
warming to 1.5 degrees C, the probability of September being ice free after the
summertime melt is a mere 1 percent. But at 2 degree C warming, that risk jumps
to 10 to 35 percent. The loss of sea ice takes away habitat for Arctic mammals
and birds. And less ice also means more exposed water, which is dark and
absorbs more sunshine.  Permanently frozen soil, which has carbon trapped
in the ground, is warming to record levels, increasing an average of 0.29
degrees Celsius from 2007 to 2016, the IPCC says. Arctic and other northern permafrost
is estimated to contain almost twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere. A
thaw in permafrost could release trapped carbon dioxide and methane into the air
— though it’s not yet certain if that’s
happening today (SN: 12/19/16).  But thaw it will, the report says. By 2100,
the expanse of Earth’s permafrost could decrease by around 24 percent in a
low-emissions scenario, or 69 percent in a high-emissions future. Under that
scenario, permafrost could exhale tens to hundreds of billions of tons of
carbon, in the form of CO2 and methane, into the atmosphere by 2100,
possibly making global warming even worse. Thawed regions might see more plant
growth, pulling some of that carbon back into the soil — but not nearly enough
to make up for carbon releases. So far, oceans have swallowed up
more than 90 percent of the climate’s excess heat, and as a result have been
warming up. Marine heat waves, which scorch coral reefs (SN: 1/4/18) and help boost the frequency of toxic algal blooms (SN: 8/28/18), are getting more severe and lasting longer
than they did decades ago (SN: 4/10/18).
And human-caused climate change may have been responsible for nearly 90 percent
of these events between 2006 and 2015, the IPCC says.  Those hot waters — which will get even hotter
under any emissions scenario — are also helping to drive many ocean-dwelling
animals to move toward cooler digs near the poles (SN: 5/2/18). But in
new environments, migrant animals can interfere with local food webs (SN: 2/2/15). Climate-driven shifts in ocean species may have already hurt overall catch potential for
the world’s fisheries (SN: 2/28/19). By 2100, ocean surfaces are expected to absorb
five to seven times more heat than they have since 1970 under a high-emissions
scenario. And heat waves would be 50 times more frequent than they were in 1900.
In a low-emissions scenario, heat waves would be 20 times more frequent by 2100
than in 1900.   It’s not just heat that oceans take in. The
world’s biggest water bodies also have absorbed an estimated 20 to 30 percent
of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere since the 1980s, causing
seawater to become more acidic (SN: 4/28/17). That’s going to continue, the IPCC says. In a high-emissions scenario, the pH of the ocean surface is expected to drop by around 0.3 pH points (on a scale of 14) by the end of the century. That acidity may make it more difficult for creatures like snails, crabs and shrimps to build their shells and impairs the function of tiny algae that ferry carbon to the deep ocean. Acidity can also deplete seawater of the minerals that corals use to build their exoskeletons (SN: 2/23/16).  Sea levels are rising faster with time. And that swell is going to continue under any emissions scenario, the IPCC says. From 2006 to 2015, sea level rose about  3.6 millimeters per year, about 2.5 times as fast as sea level rise from 1901 to 1990. Melting ice sheets and glaciers are primarily to blame. With higher sea levels come greater flooding and coastal
erosion. Encroaching seawater can also shrink habitats and force species along
coastlines to relocate — if they can. (SN:
8/6/19). Nearly half of coastal wetlands already have
disappeared over the last century, due partly to higher seawater.  In a low-emissions future, sea level rise
could reach an average 4 millimeters per year in 2100, compared with 15
millimeters per year in a high-emissions future. Higher sea levels are also
affecting the risk of certain disasters, such as coastal flooding. Extreme
events related to high seas that were once rare — happening once a century — could
happen at least once per year in many places by 2050, especially in the
tropics. That puts coastal areas and small islands
in even greater danger (SN: 8/15/18).  Human-driven climate change has likely increased
the amount of wind and rain associated with some tropical cyclones already (SN: 9/13/18).
These storms will probably get more intense, with bigger storm surges and more
rainfall, even if emissions are limited. Scientists aren’t yet sure whether
tropical cyclones will become more frequent, though.  What could become more frequent, and possibly less predicable (SN: 8/21/19), are extreme El Niño and La Niña events (SN: 1/26/15). Extreme El Niños may hit twice as often in this century compared with the last, the report says. These weather disturbances are also expected to become more hazardous, causing dryer droughts and more torrential downpours around the world. "
"510","IPCC report warns of a bleak future for oceans and frozen regions under climate change","A new IPCC report offers dire warnings about how climate change is altering oceans, the polar regions and the high snowy mountains.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-report-climate-change-bleak-future-oceans-cryosphere-solutions","Earth’s oceans and frozen regions are changing alarmingly quickly, scientists warn in the first comprehensive look at how greenhouse gas emissions are altering the planet’s seas and cryosphere.  Since 1993, the rate of
warming in the oceans has more than doubled, scientists report in a new study
by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Melting of the
two great ice sheets blanketing Greenland and West Antarctica is speeding up as
well, accelerating sea level rise. And West Antarctica’s glaciers may already
be so unstable that they are past the point of no return. “The consequences for nature
and humanity are sweeping and severe,” Ko Barrett, IPCC vice-chair and head of
research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said at a news
conference September 24. Rising seas are already threatening low-lying coastal
areas that today are home to 680 million people, about 10 percent of the
world’s population.   The Sept. 25 release of a summary
of the report coincided with the U.N.
Climate Action Summit in New York City. And it came amidst a surge of global
protests, climate strikes and calls for nations around the world to
dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions in hopes of limiting future warming.
 Such action can’t come too soon, scientists say. Already, warming ocean waters are yielding fewer fish (SN: 2/28/19), and are fueling more intense, rainier tropical storms (SN: 9/28/18). Ocean heat waves are increasing, threatening corals and other sea life (SN: 4/10/18). Greenland (SN: 9/18/19) and the West Antarctic ice sheet (SN: 8/5/19) are rapidly shedding ice, accelerating sea level rise to a rate of 3.5 millimeters per year. And Arctic sea ice continues to dwindle (SN: 3/14/19); minimum sea-ice extent in 2019 tied with 2007 and 2016, according to data released by the National Snow and Ice Data Center on September 23. That’s the second-lowest extent on satellite record, after 2012. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox “The ocean has largely been
left out of the discussion on climate,” says Becca Gisclair, senior director of
Arctic Programs for the Ocean Conservancy in Bellingham, Wash., who was not
involved in the IPCC study. The new report emphasizes the need to “slash
emissions, and do it quickly, or these impacts highlighted in the report will
quickly become irreversible…. My hope is that seeing all of these impacts in
one place can highlight the need for action.” The extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean reached its minimum for the year — 4.15 million square kilometers — on September 18, tying for the second lowest minimum in the satellite record with 2007 and 2016. The lowest measured sea ice extent was in 2012. The report is one of several
special reports focusing on the latest science on specific aspects of climate
change that the IPCC releases in between its large, sweeping assessments. Since
the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report came out in 2013, scientists have learned a
great deal about the impacts of absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide on the
oceans and their denizens, as well as in coastal areas, says Sarah Cooley,
director of the Ocean Conservancy’s ocean acidification program in Washington,
D.C. For this new report, 104 scientists from 36 countries evaluated 6,981
studies to determine the impact on the world’s oceans and ice-covered regions.  While the IPCC report rings
an alarm bell, there is hope, says climate scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, who
heads the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia.
The ocean isn’t just part of the problem, Hoegh-Guldberg says — it should be a
key part of the solution. “What’s surprising is how quickly we can limit the
damage,” Hoegh-Guldberg says, a message that he says was also embedded within the
IPCC’s 2018 special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius of
warming, for which he was a
contributing author (SN: 12/17/18).  Hoegh-Guldberg and
colleagues recently assessed ways to harness ocean resources to reduce or
mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. The study, commissioned by a group of
15 world leaders called the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, was released September 23 by the World Resources
Institute. In it, the researchers highlight five ocean-related activities that they say can help slow warming: Those five activities have the potential to account for as much as 21 percent of the emissions reductions needed by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times by the end of the century, Hoegh-Guldberg and colleagues write in the Sept. 27 Science. That help is sorely needed. Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1.1 degrees C, and studies suggest that global emissions are now on track to blow past midcentury targets needed to achieve 1.5 degrees (SN: 7/1/19).   Taken together, the two new
studies provide “a nice point-counterpoint,” says Jane Lubchenco, a marine
biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Lubchenco, who ran NOAA from
2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, is a co-chair of the High Level
Panel’s expert group of researchers and policy analysts. The IPCC special
report “shines a very bright spotlight on the ocean as a victim,” Lubchenco
says. “But it is also a powerful source of solutions.”  None of these potential
solutions are new concepts, but there has been little political will to invest
in the necessary research and development to move them forward, Hoegh-Guldberg says.
These actions may finally get some traction in December, when nations head to
Santiago, Chile, for COP25, the annual meeting to review progress of the U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change.  At the COP21 meeting in Paris in December 2015, 195 nations signed on to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, pledging to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep global warming to “well below” 2 degrees C above preindustrial times (SN: 12/12/15). The United States was one of the signing nations, but President Donald Trump has said he plans to withdraw the country from the accord in 2020 (SN: 6/1/17). Chile President Sebastián
Piñera has said COP25 will be the “Blue COP,” emphasizing the central role that
he expects ocean economies to play in the discussions. The U.N. climate meeting
in December is also a prelude to a 2020 deadline for Paris Agreement
signatories to submit revised and increasingly ambitious plans to reduce their
emissions.  Ocean-based mitigation
solutions could become a big part of those plans, Gisclair says. “There is a

The world’s existing power plants, industrial equipment, vehicles and other CO2-emitters are on track to pump out enough carbon dioxide by midcentury to blow past that target, researchers report July 1 in Nature.  Add in future power plants that are already planned, permitted or under construction, and we could emit enough by 2033 to raise average global atmospheric temperatures by 1.5 degrees, the researchers say.   If we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, then “we cannot invest more in fossil fuel power or infrastructure,” says Thorsten Mauritsen, a physical climate scientist at Stockholm University who was not involved with the work. “Everything we do from now has to change direction and not use fossil fuels.” In the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly all the world’s nations agreed to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit warming to “well below” 2 degrees by 2100 (SN: 1/9/16, p. 6). The United States has said it would pull out of the agreement (SN Online: 6/1/17), though the exit wouldn’t be complete until 2020. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Still, calls have increased since 2015 for the more ambitious goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees. That would mean fewer heat waves, spells of extreme weather and species extinctions (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7). Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1 degree. Emitting an additional 420 to 580 gigatons of CO2 could warm the planet to 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in 2018. Current infrastructure could emit that much CO2 between 2018 and as early as 2035, though it could take until 2046 to reach those totals, the new study found. Existing infrastructure, over its expected lifetime, would emit about 658 gigatons of CO2, say Steven Davis, an earth systems scientist at the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues. About 41 percent of those emissions would come from China, 9 percent from the United States and 7 percent from the European Union. Those expected global emissions rise to about 850 gigatons when proposed power plants are included. That’s enough to hit the 1.5 degree budget by 2033, and makes up roughly two-thirds of the 1,170 to 1,500 gigatons of CO2 to reach 2 degrees of warming. “This analysis … lends some concrete context to what a 1.5 degree target would mean,” Davis says. “These targets that get bandied about are very ambitious” and will require more than a few solar power projects and incremental emissions reductions, he says. Nearly 10 years ago, Davis and some colleagues performed a census of CO2–emitting infrastructure. The new study updates that census to include all known CO2 sources at the end of 2018, including power plants and industrial emitters, such as cement kilns, as well as transportation sources such as airplanes and vehicles. The update also accounts for shifts in greenhouse gas emissions caused by things such as the U.S. natural gas boom and China’s burgeoning economy. The resulting calculation is how much CO2 is “committed” to be created, unless policy or technology triggers change. The calculations don’t consider current and future efforts to mitigate emissions, for example by expanding renewable energy sources. Nor do the results account for projected emissions increases in developing economies. This work also doesn’t consider other sectors, for instance agriculture, which contributes methane, a potent greenhouse gas, says Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London in England who was not involved with the work. Still, he says, the results should serve as a wake-up call.  “This should not be seen as a fatalistic prediction of what will happen,” Roelj says. But it’s a “strong call to ensure that we make choices that reduce the carbon impact of what is currently in the pipeline.” Editor’s note: This story was updated July 24, 2019, to clarify that the study found that, by midcentury, there would be enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to increase future temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, rather than warming reaching that benchmark midcentury."
"512","The Arctic is burning and Greenland is melting, thanks to record heat","A heat wave is melting Greenland’s ice and fueling blazes across the Arctic that are pumping record amounts of carbon dioxide into the air.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-burning-greenland-melting-thanks-record-heat","The Arctic is on fire. Record-breaking temperatures and strong winds are fueling an unprecedented number of wildfires across the region this summer. In Siberia alone, hundreds of wildfires captured by satellite images July 28 spanned about 3 million hectares of land. Across Alaska, as many as 400 wildfires were burning as of mid-July. And the heat is also melting Greenland’s ice at an alarming rate. The scale and intensity of the June 2019 wildfires are unparalleled in the 16 years that the European Union’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, or CAMS, has been tracking global wildfire data. And July’s numbers “have been of similar proportions,” says CAMS senior scientist Mark Parrington. “I’ve been surprised at the duration of the fires in the Arctic Circle, in particular.” Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Wildfires most often occur in the Arctic in July and August, sparked by lightning strikes. But this year, unusually hot and dry conditions in the Northern Hemisphere in June exacerbated the problem and drove the fire season’s start earlier, the World Meteorological Organization reported July 12. Unusually high temperatures and low precipitation in the region were almost certainly fueling the July wildfires as well, Parrington says. In early August, CAMS will release its monthly bulletin summarizing the July data, he adds, and “I wouldn’t be surprised if the July fires correspond to [those climate] anomalies.” In Alaska, a heat record toppled July 4, with temperatures reaching as high as 32.2° Celsius (90° Fahrenheit). Average June temperatures in parts of Siberia were almost 10 degrees higher than the average temperatures from 1981 to 2010. That same month, more than 100 intense wildfires were burning within the Arctic Circle. On August 1, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite took this image of western Greenland. To the left of the island’s ice sheet, an active wildfire burns. Meanwhile, abundant melt ponds (appearing as blue spots) collect on the ice itself, another effect of record temperatures.    Greenland is also sweltering in the Northern Hemisphere’s heat wave: The island lost nearly 200 billion tons of ice in July, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute. On July 31, a record-breaking 56.5 percent of Greenland’s ice sheet was showing signs of melting, DMI glaciologist Ruth Mottram told the Associated Press. Images from the Copernicus satellite captured August 1 show multiple melt ponds, as well as burn scars from a recent fire and smoke from an active fire on the island. The Arctic blazes are not only scorching vast swaths of Earth; they’re also releasing copious amounts of carbon dioxide. June’s fires alone released more than 50 metric megatons of carbon dioxide, the WMO said, more than the total released by all June fires from 2010 to 2018. Total CO2 emissions from the Arctic wildfires for July are estimated at about 79 megatons, Parrington says. That’s roughly double the emissions from the previous record-setting month: July 2004. That year also set a previous annual record, with total Arctic wildfire CO2 emissions of about 110 megatons. 2019 has already smashed that record. About 79 metric megatons of carbon dioxide were emitted by wildfires in the Arctic Circle in July 2019, smashing the previous record set in July 2004. Carbon dioxide emissions from wildfires in the Arctic in July, 2003–2019 Emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are responsible for the current era of global warming (SN: 8/3/19, p. 7). Human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases have already warmed the planet by 1 degree C above preindustrial times. Temperatures in the Arctic are increasing twice as fast as the global average, further promoting the growth and persistence of wildfires in the region. Such Arctic wildfires are expected to become more common as the planet warms. There’s geologic precedent for that: Layers of black charcoal in sediments in the Canadian Arctic suggest that wildfires frequently raged across the region during the Pliocene Epoch, when global atmospheric CO2 levels were between 350 and 450 parts per million — similar to today  (SN: 12/9/17, p. 24). In June, CO2 levels averaged 413.92 ppm, according to data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Meanwhile, increasingly frequent winter warm spells, insect outbreaks and wildfires have also caused many Arctic plants to lose their resistance to freezing, dry out and die, turning large parts of the Arctic brown (SN: 4/13/19, p. 16). That, in turn, increases the region’s susceptibility to more wildfires: Normally, the icy peatlands are soggy enough to be fire-resistant, but they are thawing and drying out. Once set ablaze, the carbon-rich peat can burn for months, releasing large amounts of CO2 back into the atmosphere and fueling the warming feedback loop (SN: 3/17/18, p. 20)."
"513","Warm, dry winds may be straining Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf","Wind-induced melting that occurred during the Antarctic autumn may be accelerating the Larsen C ice shelf’s collapse, which could raise sea levels.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-dry-winds-melting-antarctica-larsen-c-ice-shelf","Turquoise pools of snowmelt on the Antarctic Peninsula, including on the Larsen C ice shelf, have recently been forming months after the continent’s peak summer melt. Bursts of warm, dry wind cascading over mountains that run along the peninsula are largely to blame, researchers report April 11 in Geophysical Research Letters. In this March 2016 satellite image, meltwater on part of Larsen C can be seen at the foothills of these mountains, just one case of this type of wind-induced melting. Eastward-flowing winds sweeping across the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes pick up enough speed to surmount its mountain peaks. As the air rises and chills, its moisture condenses and, in the process, reheats the air. So when the now-dry air comes coursing down the leeway mountainside, it can be a balmy 20° Celsius. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Researchers “have told me they’ve been in a T-shirt” while standing in these winds, says cryospheric scientist Tri Datta of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.  Datta and her team compared satellite data collected from 1982 to 2017 with simulations of the peninsula’s ice sheet and atmospheric conditions during the same period. The team found that, since 2015, these winds called foehns have caused a lot of melting on the peninsula, including on Larsen C, as late as May, well into Antarctica’s autumn. Foehns likely cause 60 percent of the total snowmelt on the northeastern part of the peninsula at that time of year, Datta says. That’s a problem because meltwater can trickle into crevasses on Larsen C. The water’s own weight wedges the cracks open and may help cause the ice shelf to break off. Late melting can also prevent new snow from replenishing the ice shelf. In 2017, a giant iceberg broke from Larsen C, raising questions about the shelf’s stability and how it may contribute to rising seas (SN: 8/5/17, p. 6). It’s still unclear what’s driving these foehns and if they’re linked to climate change. And Datta emphasizes that three years is too short to constitute a trend. But without Larsen C, which buttresses multiple glaciers, glacial ice flow to the ocean could accelerate and contribute to rising global sea levels. "
"514","Mercury levels in fish are rising despite reduced emissions","Climate change and overfishing can increase how much mercury accumulates in fish, counteracting efforts to reduce human-caused emissions.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-levels-fish-are-rising-despite-reduced-emissions","Climate change and overfishing may be hampering efforts to reduce toxic mercury accumulations in the fish and shellfish that end up on our plates. Mercury emissions are decreasing around the globe. But new research suggests that warmer ocean waters and fishing’s effects on ecosystems can alter how much mercury builds up in seafood. Fishing practices increased methylmercury levels in the tissue of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) caught in the Gulf of Maine by as much as 23 percent over a roughly 30-year period, researchers estimate. That’s despite decreases in atmospheric mercury levels over the same time period, from the 1970s to the 2000s. The finding is based on simulations of mercury emissions as well as ecosystem changes related to fishing. It reveals how the diet of cod, driven by the rebound of once-overfished herring, plays an important role in determining how much mercury accumulates in the fish, the team reports online August 7 in Nature. The scientists also created simulations of the effects of warming seawater on mercury bioaccumulation, incorporating changing emissions and temperatures as well as mercury accumulations measured in Gulf of Maine Atlantic bluefin tuna since 1969. Those simulations suggest that seawater temperature increases could be responsible for as much as a 56 percent increase in methylmercury concentrations found in Gulf of Maine Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the team found. “This is really the first investigation to look at migratory marine fish and the potential impacts of temperature and overfishing” at the same time, says study coauthor Elsie Sunderland, an environmental chemist at Harvard University. Scientists have long assumed that when it comes to mercury piling up in seafood, the only factor that matters is how much is being sent into the sky, she says. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Simulations suggest that the level of methylmercury in Gulf of Maine seawater has decreased since the 1970s, thanks to more regulation of emissions from coal-fired power plants (below).  Methylmercury in Gulf of Maine seawater A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 But measured seawater temperatures are increasing around the globe, and the Gulf of Maine waters are warming particularly quickly relative to the global average (below).  Gulf of Maine temperature deviation from global average A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 Those effects impact how much mercury accumulates in Atlantic bluefin tuna caught in the region, simulations show (below). If emissions alone were considered, tuna mercury levels should follow the trend of the dotted line – first rising after the 1970s and then dropping off. But new research reveals that mercury levels in tuna depend on both emissions and water temperatures (solid line), with an early peak related to emissions and then a steady increase since about 2000 that corresponds to rising seawater temperatures.  Effect of water mercury levels and temperature on tuna A. Schartup et al/Nature 2019 Emissions do matter, but are only one piece of the puzzle. Mercury emissions, as inorganic mercury, can come from both human activities such as burning coal or natural sources like volcanoes. Eventually, that mercury rains back down onto Earth’s surface. Microorganisms then convert the mercury into an organic form called methylmercury that can cling to organic matter. When tiny creatures consume that matter, the metal gets stored in their fatty tissues. And so on up the food chain: As increasingly larger animals eat methylmercury-laden dinners, more and more of the metal accumulates in the predators. In oceans, this toxic trek can go from zooplankton to small fish and crustaceans, then bigger fish and, finally, people. That accumulation can be deadly: Methylmercury poisoning can damage the central nervous and digestive systems, causing cognitive damage, kidney failure and death. The good news is that emissions are no longer on the rise. From 1990 to 2010, mercury emissions from human activities decreased from 2,890 megagrams per year to 2,280 megagrams per year. Emissions, particularly from the European Union and the United States, continue to decline, according to a global assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme. A 2017 global treaty to reduce emissions could lower those numbers further. In the United States, mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants dropped from about 41,700 kilograms in 2006 to about 6,300 kilograms in 2016, a decrease of 85 percent. That decrease is the direct result of state regulations on emissions and, later, a 2011 federal standard, Sunderland says. But, surprisingly, that hasn’t led to a straightforward decrease in the mercury measured in fish. Some fish in the Gulf of Maine, such as Atlantic cod, showed increases in mercury in their tissues over time, the team found. Others, including the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), showed decreases. To try to solve that mystery, biogeochemist Amina Schartup of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and colleagues zoomed in more closely on the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. The area has a long history of intense scrutiny, both as a historical fishing ground as a hot spot for global warming. Seawater temperatures there are among the fastest rising in the world. The team looked at methylmercury levels in seawater, sediments and across the ecosystem. The researchers also wanted to compare these data with changes in the diets of Atlantic cod and spiny dogfish through time. To do this, the team analyzed the stomach contents of the two species from the 1970s and 2000s, using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s extensive records on fish stocks in the region. Mercury differences between the two types of fish were directly related to diet changes resulting from humans’ fishing habits, the researchers found. Cod and dogfish both prefer to eat herring, but in the 1970s, herring populations in the region collapsed due to overfishing. So the cod turned to smaller herring, which have relatively lower mercury levels, and the dogfish turned to heavily mercury-laden squid. But then herring came back on the menu as its populations rebounded after the 1970s. Dogfish ate fewer squid, and their mercury increases slowed. Cod, on the other hand, saw a more dramatic increase in mercury accumulation. Seawater temperatures in the Gulf of Maine may also alter mercury accumulation. Using calculations of energy expenditure, growth and prey consumption for Atlantic bluefin tuna, the researchers estimated how much warming waters increase fish activity. More active fish consume more food and accumulate more mercury, which could explain higher than expected mercury levels measured in the fish given declining emissions, the scientists suggest.   Next, the team plans to expand these simulations beyond the Gulf of Maine, Sunderland says. “That’s really the goal,” she says. “To understand the changing impacts for all these ecosystems.” William Cheung, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, says another step will be to link these findings to public health, and to make projections for future seafood safety. “It’s a really important piece of work,” he says. “Historically, we’ve only looked at these problems individually: climate change, overfishing, contamination…. We may be underestimating the level of risk and impacts.” But efforts to project those risks going forward is a task made trickier by some uncertainty in future mercury emissions, particularly from the United States. In December 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed weakening its mercury regulations, suggesting that they are no longer “appropriate or necessary.” Yet those regulations “are a tremendous environmental success story,” Sunderland says. Rolling those regulations back could undo a lot of the good that they have done, she says. “The situation would be much worse without them.”"
"515","Ancient crystal growths in caves reveal seas rose 16 meters in a warmer world","The Pliocene era cave formations on the Spanish coast of Mallorca offer hints about how oceans could respond to human-driven climate change.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-crystal-growth-caves-reveal-seas-rose-16-meters-warmer-world","The
future of sea level rise may be written into the walls of coastal Spanish caves. Mineral
“bathtub rings” deposited inside the limestone Artà Caves on
the Balearic island of Mallorca show how high seas rose during the
Pliocene Epoch — a time when Earth was
about as warm as it’s expected to get by 2100. Those mineral deposits suggest the
planet’s seas were
around 16 meters higher on average than they are today,
researchers report August 30 in Nature.
 That measurement provides the most precise peek yet
into what may come as climate change causes ice sheets to melt and ocean waters
to rise — a process that could happen
over hundreds to thousands of years. Previous estimates of Pliocene sea levels gave
similar results, but relied on more indirect dating methods or failed to
incorporate information about the subsequent rise and fall of the Earth’s
crust. The Artà analysis, however, takes that rise and fall into account.  The new study’s combination of precision dating and corrected
sea levels also may help answer a crucial question: How much of Earth’s biggest
ice sheet melted during the Pliocene? These sea level measurements suggest that,
while smaller ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica melted severely, only
the parts of the massive eastern Antarctic ice sheet that jutted into the sea
melted during that era, says Alan Haywood, a paleoclimatologist
at Leeds University in England who was not
involved in the study. It’s still unclear, however, how today’s unique warming
patterns will affect ice sheets. “Anything that gives us added information on how
sensitive the ice sheets are … is going to be very important,” Haywood says. Conditions during the Pliocene, 5.33 million to 2.58
million years ago, may offer the best example of what a human-addled
climate will eventually look like (SN:
11/28/17). In the past, paleoclimatologists mainly
used two approaches in reconstructing Pliocene sea level changes. One links ratios
of two types of oxygen, or isotopes, in fossilized sea creatures to a global
record of oxygen ratios and ice sheet cycles. The other uses the ages of ancient
coral reefs to estimate ancient sea levels. For the new study, researchers searched
caves for evidence of past sea level change (SN:
4/15/13). “Caves are a very protected environment,”
says study coauthor Oana-Alexandra Dumitru, a geochemist at the University of South Florida in Tampa who began
collaborating with Mallorcan researchers as a
graduate student. “We don’t worry about erosion and other weathering after
deposition as much as you would about terrestrial or other records.”  In the 1970s, Mallorcan researchers found aragonite and calcite deposits on stalactites and
stalagmites in the Artà Caves. The deposits, called phreatic overgrowths,
accumulate over years when brackish seawater laps against the rock. Similar features
have been found in coastal caves on the Italian island of Sardinia and in Mexico
and Japan. Early dating attempts in the 1990s and 2000s focused on samples only
a few hundreds of thousands of years old. But Dumitru and colleagues used a
dating method capable of reaching back further in time, comparing ratios of
uranium to lead in the minerals, to determine when the much older Pliocene deposits
formed. As Earth’s temperatures rose, higher levels of seawater
washed into the caves. That rising water left behind mineral deposits at
heights from 14.7 to 23.5 meters above today’s sea level, Dumitru’s team found.
 One of the lower deposits corresponds with the mid-Piacenzian
Warm Period, which lasted from about 3.3 million to 3 million years ago. Global
temperatures during that time period were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius warmer than in
modern, preindustrial times —
and resemble leading forecasts for the year 2100. Global mean sea levels then were
16.2 meters higher than today, Dumitru and colleagues calculate.  The higher of the six mineral deposits studied corresponds to the Pliocene’s warmest period about 4.39 million years ago, when temperatures were about 4 degrees C higher than in preindustrial times. That Artà sample suggests that seas were about 23.5 meters higher than today. “We still may not know exactly how much sea level rose,” Haywood says. But with results like these, “we’re getting more confidence that we’re in the right ballpark.”  "

As a result, foodborne Campylobacter infections could increase with climate change, proposes epidemiologist Melanie Cousins of the University of Waterloo in Canada.  Cousins’ computer simulation, still a proof-of-concept version, focuses on how the warm weather surge in house flies and their activity affects the typical spring-summer rise in Campylobacter cases. Under a scenario of summers 2.5 degrees Celsius warmer on average than in 2003, the simulation predicts about 28 percent more Campylobacter cases in the Canadian province of Ontario by 2050, she and colleagues say February 13 in Royal Society Open Science. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Campylobacter infections are most often caused by contaminated food, perhaps by a fly that’s strolled on other tainted food, an infected animal or feces. Most people recover from an infection within about 10 days. The bacteria are the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness in Canada, with Ontario averaging more than 3,000 cases a year. The United States has some 1.3 million infections a year. To set up a simplified simulation, Cousins used data from 2005 on reported Campylobacter infections in Ontario to estimate transmission rates and fly birth and death rates. She then plugged those rates into the simulation to predict subsequent years’ Campylobacter infections. Those results came close to the real data available through 2013, and allowed her to predict future infections under different warming scenarios. The simulation assumes flies become more active with climate change since, like other insects, they depend on ambient temperatures for heating and cooling. It also assumes bacterial increases with warming. The study is just the latest to highlight consequences of warming on insect behavior. Other studies have predicted how climate change might increase pest attacks on crops (SN: 9/29/18, p. 8) and affect public health, such as Lyme disease’s creep into Canada (SN: 8/19/17, p. 16)."
"517","Climate misinformation may be thriving on YouTube, a social scientist warns","Analyzing 200 climate-related videos on YouTube shows that a majority challenge widely accepted views about climate change and climate engineering.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-misinformation-may-be-thriving-youtube-social-scientist-warns","Beware what you view about climate change on YouTube. Conspiracy theorists have hijacked some climate-related terms to spread misinformation on the online video-sharing website, a social scientist warns. He urges his colleagues to respond by getting accurate information about their work to science communicators on YouTube.  While Facebook and Twitter get the lion’s share of attention when it comes to concerns about fake news, Joachim Allgaier of RWTH Aachen University in Germany says YouTube is equally, if not more insidious, given its huge popularity. Allgaier, who focuses on how science is communicated online, initially researched science-themed music videos on the site. He found several on Darwin’s theory of evolution, one song about the periodic table by the band They Might Be Giants and a parody by an Alzheimer’s research team contorting the lyrics to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” to sing about being “caught in a bad project.” “I was amazed by the creativity,” Allgaier says. But he was also disturbed by music videos attacking established science. Those science skeptics questioned the fact that human activities are driving climate change, the use of chemotherapy to treat cancer and the safety of vaccines. So Allgaier decided to investigate what kind of YouTube videos he found when he searched the site using 10 different climate-related terms, including “climate change,” “global warming” and “climate science.” He also searched for “climate manipulation” and “geoengineering,” terms that refer to emerging large-scale technologies to cool the Earth and offset global warming, such as adding tiny, sunlight-blocking particles high in the stratosphere (SN: 11/28/15, p. 26). To prevent earlier searches from shaping the results of later searches, Allgaier obscured his IP address, location and search history. Then, he analyzed the top 20 videos for each of the 10 terms. Of those 200 videos, 89 support the established scientific premise that climate change is the result of human activities. But four feature neutral debates between scientists and climate change skeptics, and 16 deny that humans are causing climate change. Most strikingly, 91 videos promote conspiracy theories about climate change or climate engineering, particularly about so-called chemtrails, Allgaier reports July 25 in Frontiers in Communication. Chemtrailers believe politicians or government agents are spreading toxic chemicals through airplanes’ condensation trails — an idea unrelated to climate change, and not supported by science. Many people could view that misinformation, Allgaier warns. YouTube says that it reaches roughly 2 billion users each month, or about a third of all internet users — making it a powerful communication tool. A 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., questioned 4,581 adults in the United States from July 30 to August 12 and found that 21 percent of people get their news from YouTube. In Germany, over 70 percent of another survey’s respondents aged 14 to 29 reported using YouTube and other online video platforms to be informed about science. That survey, by Berlin-based science communications company Science in Dialogue, questioned 1,008 people from August 6 to August 13, 2018. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Allgaier also found that more common search terms like “climate change” and “global warming” typically lead to accurate videos. But newer terms like “geoengineering” and “climate modification” lead to those chemtrail videos almost 93 percent of the time. Some geoengineering ideas are perfect fodder for conspiracy theorists, especially ones that propose injecting particles into the atmosphere. Plus, geoengineering is a relatively new research area, and geoscientists have a minimal presence on YouTube, Allgaier says. That has enabled conspiracy theorists to hijack terms related to the technology through tactics like mirroring, where followers upload a video to multiple YouTube channels and tag each version with different keywords to dominate the online-video database. Other tactics include making it easier for people discover links to the conspiracy videos during searches through search engine optimization and commenting on legitimate science videos with links to conspiracy content.   Scientists and science communicators must flood YouTube with scientifically accurate content, and even mimic those conspiracy tactics, Allgaier argues, to reclaim scientific terms that have been highjacked. Otherwise, researchers risk ceding control of information about their work to the conspirators. “It’s necessary to take action,” he says."

They gleam blue or white when they catch the sun’s rays, even after the night has fallen on land. “They’re beautiful,” says James Russell, an atmospheric scientist at Hampton University in Virginia. “It’s hard to take your eyes off of them, because they’re so iridescent.” Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The clouds form when cold temperatures, around -130° Celsius, cause water vapor to condense and freeze around dust particles, making nanometer-sized ice crystals. What stood out in June was how wet the mesosphere was. “It’s record-setting,” says Lynn Harvey, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. Possible explanations for that extra wetness include more moist air ascending in summertime than usual, or an increase in the atmosphere of methane, which can be oxidized to form water vapor. A satellite image released by NASA’s Earth Observatory shows these noctilucent clouds covering the Arctic on June 12, with white areas showing where sunlight is reflected the most off the clouds and dark purple the least.

Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Though increasingly frequent, such floods often last only a few hours. That can make it hard to tally the economic losses they cause. Hino and her colleagues sought to quantify those impacts by looking at parking data in the historic downtown of Annapolis, Md., located on the Chesapeake Bay.  The team first built a database of flood events using flood images posted to social media at the same times that tide gauge readings showed high water levels, in order to eliminate rain-caused flooding. Hino’s team estimates there were 44 tidal floods in 2017, classified as minor, modest or severe. The team then looked at parking transactions in a nearby lot for changes in parking revenues. Flood events coincided with drops in visitation ranging from 37 to 89 percent, depending on the severity of the flooding, the researchers found. That contributed to about 3,000 fewer visitors, or a 1.7 percent decrease, in 2017, according to the study published online February 15 in Science Advances. While combined 2017 annual revenues for 16 area businesses totaled $12.2 million in 2017, the researchers did not have access to the shops’ daily financials. So they looked to city data tallying daily revenues at downtown businesses for dates that flooded (defined as moderate to severe on Hino’s scale) in 2016 but not 2015. They found that revenues on those days dropped by 22.5 percent on average. That let researchers estimate the economic losses caused by flooding’s impact on visitors in 2017. A 1.7 percent drop in annual visitors would have led to between a 0.7 percent and a 1.4 percent loss in revenues for the 16 downtown businesses — or between $86,000 to $172,000, Hino and her colleagues conclude. Because seas are expected to continue rising in coming decades (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7), such tidal flood losses are likely to increase, says Hino, who also presented the work at a Feb. 14 news conference at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The study is useful in drawing attention to costs and damages from tidal flooding, says Hamed Moftakhari, a civil and environmental engineer at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa who was not involved in the study. But the situation beyond a small downtown parking lot is likely to be much more complex than what the study encapsulates, he says. “I would love to see some more comprehensive representation of the cost than just parking lot transactions.”"
"520","Rare eastern equine encephalitis has killed 9 people in the U.S. in 2019","2019 is the worst eastern equine encephalitis outbreak since tracking began in 2003, with 31 cases and nine deaths from the brain infection so far.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-disease-eastern-equine-encephalitis-killed-nine-people-2019","The worst outbreak of eastern
equine encephalitis since U.S. health officials began
monitoring the mosquito-borne disease
15 years ago is prompting aerial bug spraying and dire warnings to avoid the
biting insects well into fall. As of October 1, 31 cases — including nine
deaths — have been reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.  Known as EEE or Triple-E for
short, the incurable brain infection is still relatively rare — there have been only 103 reported infections in the
United States in the past decade. Only five percent of people bitten by an
infected mosquito will develop the disease. But about a third of EEE patients die, and many who survive experience permanent
neurological problems.  Science
News spoke with several researchers about how the
virus spreads, and possible factors that might be contributing to the recent
surge in cases.  “We don’t know some of the
basic details about these [mosquito-transmitted] diseases, unfortunately,” says
pathobiologist Stephen Higgs, director of the Biosecurity Research Institute at
Kansas State University in Manhattan. “The ideal is to anticipate outbreaks,
which is very, very difficult. But we need to be prepared for an outbreak when
it comes.” Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The virus that causes eastern
equine encephalitis is initially carried by Culiseta
melanura mosquitoes, which feed on blood from birds (SN: 4/9/19) and rarely bite
humans. However, other mosquito species, including Aedes mosquitoes, can
pick the virus up from infected birds and then spread the virus to humans and
other mammals, including horses — which is how EEE originally got its name.  When an infected mosquito
bites a person, the insect spits a solution of substances that help prevent
blood from clotting, making it easier to suck blood. “That’s why you might have
that little red bump —
because it’s spitting into you,” Higgs says. “If there are viruses in those
salivary glands as it’s spitting, it will also spit virus into you.” About 30 percent of the 103 eastern equine encephalitis cases recorded in the last decade have occurred in 2019. On average, there are about seven human cases of EEE in the United States each year. Infected patients may first
experience a fever, headache, chills or muscle and bone pain. If the virus moves
to the central nervous system, it can cause encephalitis, or swelling of the
brain. With no cure for EEE, doctors can only treat the symptoms and help to
boost a patient’s immune response to the infection.  The northeastern United States has been most affected by
the disease, along with states along
U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Great Lakes region. These states tend to have humid
forests and swampy areas where mosquitoes like to breed.  Of the 31 cases confirmed as of October 1, 12 have been in Massachusetts, nine in Michigan, three in New Jersey, three in Rhode Island, two in Connecticut, one in North Carolina and one in Tennessee, according to CDC spokeswoman Maggie Silver. At least nine people have died, according to the CDC’s Oct. 1 tally. “We’ve got cases in states which have really not typically had human cases,” including Tennessee, Higgs says. And Connecticut, with two new cases, had only seen one other case, in 2013. Virus also has been detected in 2019 in mosquitoes in several states — including Maine, New York and Louisiana  —  that have not had human cases this year. The eastern equine encephalitis virus has infected humans in 22 U.S. states, mostly around the Gulf Coast, in the Great Lakes region and along the Atlantic coast. In 2019, Tennessee became the 22nd state to record a case.  Researchers aren’t sure, but
suggest a combination of factors could be to blame. Also unclear is whether the
current disease surge is an anomaly, or if the country might see higher numbers
of cases in future years as well.  “With any mosquito-borne
disease, it’s cyclical,” says Silver. The number of cases rises in summer, when
mosquito populations swell, and declines as temperatures drop and frost kills
off the adult insects.  Conditions that encourage mosquitoes to proliferate can increase the disease risk, such as warmer
temperatures (SN: 3/13/12). “One of
the reasons we’re seeing outbreak cycles more frequently is probably related to
the fact that the mosquito breeding season is longer now,” says Catherine
Brown, state epidemiologist with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in
Boston. That’s cause for concern, given that climate change is pushing average temperatures up across the globe (SN:
7/1/19).  Rainfall can also have an
effect. Because mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, small pockets of
undisturbed water are crucial for breeding. And lots of rain means more such breeding grounds, which could “set up
the stage for us to have very large mosquito populations,” Brown says.  The best way to prevent a
Triple-E infection is to avoid being bitten by a mosquito in the first place. The CDC recommends using insect
repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants and keeping doors and windows
closed. People also can make sure there is no standing water around their
homes, and avoid other breeding areas such as swamps at dawn and dusk, when
mosquitoes are most active. Some counties in affected states including Massachusetts have begun spraying against mosquitoes. “Aerial spraying is a way to cover large geographic areas in a relatively efficient way,” Brown says. But it can’t eliminate the EEE infection risk or get rid of all mosquitoes. “It’s not a magic bullet.” "
"521","Collapsing ice cliffs may not contribute to sea level rise","Scientists debate a controversial hypothesis that suggests that massive crumbling ice cliffs could speed up future sea level rise.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-sheets-collapse-sea-level-rise-climate-change","Sea level rise over the next century won’t get a feared boost from Antarctic ice cliffs crumbling into the ocean like dominoes, a new study suggests. The finding, published February 7 in Nature, is based on a new statistical analysis showing that such a rapid collapse of marine ice cliffs in Antarctica was extremely unlikely to have happened in the past, even during some of Earth’s warmest episodes over the last 3 million years. The study, by climate scientist Tamsin Edwards of King’s College London and colleagues, counters a controversial hypothesis that suggests that rising greenhouse gas emissions could destabilize those cliffs and help send sea levels surging by over 2.1 meters by 2100. That figure is nearly double some sea level rise projections for the end of the century. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox How quickly human-caused global warming is causing the great ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica to melt into the sea is one of the most urgent questions related to future sea level rise. Some scientists fear that melting could speed up dramatically sometime in the future, thanks to a possible feedback loop known as marine ice-cliff instability, or MICI.  The hypothesis was described by geoscientist Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and paleoclimatologist David Pollard of Penn State in a 2016 study in Nature. Using computer simulations of the mechanical and structural properties of ice, the researchers suggested that ice cliffs at the edges of glaciers that jut into the sea are a dramatically underestimated source of future sea level rise (SN: 4/30/16, p. 13). “Ice that flows into the ocean essentially always ends in a cliff,” DeConto says. “Basic physics tells us that very tall cliffs, extending 100 meters or more above the water surface, will begin to produce stresses in the ice that can exceed its strength.” When that happens, the ice breaks, or calves, and giant blocks of ice tumble into the sea. The collapse of such cliffs would then create new cliffs behind them that would tumble as well, in a kind of domino effect. One reason the MICI hypothesis was controversial is that there are a lot of uncertainties about the progression and effects of such cliff collapse, Edward says. Would all the blocks end up in the sea? How much surface melting of the ice would there be, and how would that meltwater help speed the fractures along? “We would all agree that ice cliffs might have a maximum height and above that they’re unstable, that the strength of ice has a limit,” she says. But the question is how that translates to sea level rise. To figure out whether a MICI feedback might have actually happened in Earth’s past, Edwards and her colleagues ran a statistical analysis of the original MICI simulation. They wanted to determine the likelihood that sea level rise during warm episodes might have been linked to ice-cliff collapse in Antarctica. The researchers focused on the mid-Pliocene warm period that lasted from about 3.3 million to 3 million years ago, the last interglacial period 130,000 to 115,000 years ago, and the years from 1992 to 2017, which span the time for which satellite data of the rate of ice mass loss exist. The original computer simulations of ice-cliff collapse by DeConto and Pollard included only about 64 iterations. “We were limited by cost in how many simulations we can run,” says DeConto. Edwards’ team, however, mapped out statistically how the simulation would respond in 10,000 different iterations, by changing parameters from the estimated rate of atmospheric warming to estimated past sea level rise. The MICI hypothesis, the researchers found, wasn’t needed to reproduce any of the past sea level changes during those three time periods. DeConto says he’s happy that researchers are trying to test the ice-cliff instability theory. “I think we’ve shaken some trees,” he says. “The fact that folks are pushing back is a good thing.” And Edwards’ team’s study, he adds, highlighted the usefulness of statistically analyzing many possible outcomes for a computer simulation. Meanwhile, he, Pollard and other colleagues presented an updated computer simulation of how MICI might affect future sea level rise in December in Washington, D.C., at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting. Their newest findings support the Edwards’ team’s conclusion that marine ice-cliff instability won’t double sea levels by 2100 — but suggest that’s only because the ice-cliff instability hasn’t really kicked in yet. By 2200, they say, the picture is far less rosy: If greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current track, MICI could help bump up sea level up to as much as 4 meters higher than they were in 2000."
"522","1 million species are under threat. Here are 5 ways we speed up extinctions","One million of the world’s plant and animal species are now under threat of extinction, a new report finds.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/1-million-species-under-threat-humans-speed-extinction","Stories about individual species on the brink of extinction may be all too familiar. But a new tally now reveals the breadth of the conservation crisis: One million of the world’s species are now poised to vanish, some as soon as within the next few decades. That number, which amounts to 1 in every 8 animal or plant species on Earth, comes from a sweeping new analysis of about 15,000 studies conducted within the last 50 years on topics ranging from biodiversity to climate to the health of ecosystems. During that time, the human population has doubled, increasing from 3.7 billion in 1970 to 7.6 billion today. And people are behind the looming losses, an international group of scientists says. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Thanks to human activities, the rate of global species extinctions is tens to hundreds of times faster than the average extinction rate was over the last 10 million years, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, or IPBES, concludes in a summary of the study published May 6. The intergovernmental group, which has 132 nations as members including the United States, will release its full 1,500-page report in about six months. The report contains many other sobering numbers: More than 40 percent of amphibian species are threatened, along with 33 percent of marine mammals, 33 percent of sharks and reef-building corals and 10 percent of insects. Right now, the rate of global species extinctions is tens to hundreds of times faster than the average extinction rate was over the last 10 million years. And if human activities continue unabated, the rate of extinctions will continue to accelerate, the report states. Here are the top five ways that people are speeding up the losses: The top threat to species on land due to humans is habitat loss, the report says. About 75 percent of land on Earth has been “severely altered” by human actions. Since 1992, urban areas have grown by more than 100 percent. Elsewhere, agriculture to feed the world’s growing population has taken over many once-diverse habitats such as old-growth forests, wetlands and grasslands. The report notes that 85 percent of wetlands that were present in 1700 were lost by 2000, and that forests now cover just 68 percent of the area they covered in preindustrial times. What’s more, the production of food crops is up by 300 percent since 1970, and in the world’s tropical regions, agricultural lands expanded by 100 million hectares from 1980 to 2000. In Southeast Asia, palm oil plantations have edged out once-intact forests, while in Central America, cattle ranches have expanded into forested areas (SN Online: 9/13/18). Habitat loss is a problem in the oceans, too — about 66 percent of the ocean surface area has been altered by human actions, the report finds. But the top threat to marine creatures from people is overexploitation. Industrial fishing spans more than 55 percent of the ocean’s surface area, and about 33 percent of the ocean’s fish stocks are being harvested at unsustainable levels. Among the world’s most overfished species are Atlantic halibut, bluefin tuna and all types of sharks. Other species, such as dolphins and loggerhead turtles, suffer as bycatch when they are inadvertently trapped during fishing activities. The world has already warmed by an average of about 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times (SN: 12/22/18, p. 18). That warming is linked to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as floods, fires and droughts, as well as to rising seas and to shifts in where species are distributed around the globe (SN: 1/19/19, p. 7). And warmer ocean waters are also placing stress on many fish populations, reducing the amount of fish that can be caught sustainably, without doing long-term damage to populations (SN: 3/30/19, p. 5). Land-use changes are also tied to climate change: Land clearing, crop production and the use of fertilizers currently account for about 25 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Three-quarters of those emissions come from animal-based foods (SN: 7/7/18, p. 10). And as a result of decreasing diversity, some tropical forests are contributing more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than they are absorbing (SN: 10/28/17, p. 9). Among the worst recent offenders is marine plastic pollution, which has increased tenfold since 1980 and affects at least 267 species, including 86 percent of marine turtles, 44 percent of seabirds and 43 percent of marine mammals, the report states (SN Online: 3/22/18). Plastics, particularly microplastics, can find their way into soils, too (SN: 5/12/18, p. 14). And other kinds of pollution are still a problem, including untreated urban and rural waste, mining and agricultural waste and oil spills (SN: 3/17/18, p. 5). Thanks to global trade and travel, humans have introduced invasive species to vulnerable areas around the world: Across 21 countries with the most detailed records, the number of invasive species per country has increased by about 70 percent since 1970, the report finds. Those invaders not only compete with native species for water and other resources, but also — like the frog-killing chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (SN: 4/27/19, p. 5) or the tree-munching emerald ash borer — can wipe out vast numbers of native animals or plants. Humans can still slow the loss of species, the researchers note. Conservation investments from 1996 to 2008 have already reduced the extinction risk for mammals and birds in 109 countries by 29 percent.  But saving more species will require “transformative changes” in behavior, the report states, including how people consume energy, food and water, and how they use land and technology."
"523","The largest seaweed bloom ever detected spanned the Atlantic in 2018","Nutrient-rich water from the Amazon River may be helping massive seaweed mats to flourish each summer in the Atlantic Ocean.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/largest-seaweed-bloom-ever-detected-atlantic-ocean-2018","During the summer, vast, floating islands of Sargassum algae can blanket entire parts of the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The algae reached their largest extent on record in June 2018, forming a giant brown belt that extended for 8,850 kilometers from the west coast of Africa into the Gulf of Mexico. At least 20 million metric tons of Sargassum made up the belt, the largest bloom of seaweed ever detected, researchers say. Satellite data tracking the extent of the mats over the last 19 years reveal a sudden, dramatic increase in the summer of 2011, and recurring almost every year since, the scientists report in the July 5 Science. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox These annual massive mats of seaweed, which the researchers have dubbed the great Atlantic Sargassum belt, have been fueled in part by increasing nutrients pouring into the ocean from the Amazon River, the study suggests. Forests can both filter and regulate the flow of water from land to ocean. But with increasing fertilizer use and deforestation anticipated in the coming decades along the Amazon’s tributaries, such colossal blooms may become a new normal. The floating algae islands have long provided an important shelter for turtles, fish, crabs, eels and other marine species (SN Online: 4/13/17). But there can be too much of a good thing, particularly when Sargassum mats crowd coastlines. They can smother corals and seagrass, and wreak havoc on coasts across the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico as heavy, meters-thick layers of the seaweed wash up on beaches and rot (SN Online: 8/28/15). To track the waxing and waning of the Sargassum, the researchers, led by optical oceanographer Mengqiu Wang of the University of South Florida in Tampa, used data from satellite instruments that scan the ocean in visible and infrared light wavelengths. Sargassum algae, like photosynthesizing plants, contain abundant chlorophyll-a. That pigment pings brightly at infrared wavelengths, creating a sharp and easily detectable contrast to the darker water beneath. From 2000 to 2010, there was little of the algae in the central Atlantic, with the occasional patch near the mouth of the Amazon River in the summer and fall. But a tipping point occurred in 2011, when the line of seaweed suddenly and dramatically extended all the way across the ocean, the team found. That change in 2011 “was really surprising,” says James Gower, an optical oceanographer at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in North Saanich, British Columbia, who coauthored a commentary in the same issue of Science. “It really stood out in the satellite data.” Each year since, except 2013, the algae have formed a similar, vast belt. In 2018, that belt was the largest and densest yet, the team reports, containing at least 20 million metric tons of algae — about four times the weight of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Since 2011, satellites have detected a wide swath of Sargassum algae, dubbed the great Atlantic Sargassum belt, extending from the west coast of Africa to the Gulf of Mexico each July (monthly mean density, shown). The year 2013 is the one exception, when above-average sea-surface temperatures may have suppressed the seaweed’s growth. The largest extent on record occurred in 2018.  Sargassum algae growth in the Atlantic Ocean in July, 2011–2018 USF College of Marine Science Two sources of nutrients appear to be feeding the blooms: discharge from the Amazon River and upwelling along the coast of West Africa. Upwelling, in which surface waters are pushed aside by strong prevailing winds, allowing deeper, nutrient-rich waters to rise toward the surface, occurs there naturally, due to the interaction of winds, ocean and the rotation of the Earth. How those nutrients will change in the future is uncertain. There’s a lot that scientists still don’t know about the sources of those nutrients, as well as how climate change will affect the seaweed’s life cycle. Nutrients carried on dust blown into the ocean from the Sahara, as well as inputs from Africa’s Congo River, may also have a role. And, particularly warm sea-surface temperatures, such as occurred in 2013, appear to suppress the algae’s growth, the team notes. That casts some doubt on the fate of the blooms in a warming world. Having this global eye on the seaweed has been key to beginning to understand the sudden growth. Even higher-resolution satellite data collected over the world’s oceans could help researchers better track the movement of the algae and suss out what’s really causing the blooms, Gower says."

This is the year we learned that the 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming won’t be enough to forestall significant impacts of climate change. And a new field of research explicitly attributed some extreme weather events to human-caused climate change. This one-two punch made it clear that climate change isn’t just something to worry about in the coming decades. It’s already here. This looming problem was apparent three years ago when nearly all of the world’s nations agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial times by 2100 (SN: 1/9/16, p. 6). That pact was hard-won, but even then, some scientists sounded a note of caution: That target wouldn’t be stringent enough to prevent major changes. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox So the United Nations took an unprecedented step. It commissioned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to examine how the world might fare if global warming were limited to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees. That report, released in October, confirmed that half a degree can indeed make a world of difference (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7). A half degree less warming means less sea level rise, fewer species lost due to vanished habitats and fewer life-threatening heat, drought and precipitation extremes (SN: 6/9/18, p. 6). There’s little time to reverse course. The IPCC report notes that the planet’s average temperature has already increased by nearly 1 degree since preindustrial times, and that rise is contributing to extinctions, lower crop yields and more frequent wildfires. At the end of 2017, three attribution studies for the first time determined that certain extreme events, including an extended marine heat wave in the Pacific Ocean known as “the Blob,” would not have happened without human-induced climate change (SN: 1/20/18, p. 6). Capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels rather than 2 degrees can soften climate impacts.  Source: IPCC 2018 This year, researchers reported that the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season got a boost from warm waters in the tropical Atlantic, fueled by climate change (SN Online: 9/28/18). And a team of scientists determined that climate change was the engine behind September’s intense rainfall from Hurricane Florence in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States (SN Online: 9/13/18). A report released November 23 by hundreds of U.S. climate scientists from 13 federal agencies put a price tag on many of the effects for the United States (SN Online: 11/28/18). The report predicts the country’s economy will shrink by as much as 10 percent by 2100 if global warming continues on its current trajectory. Climate simulations suggest that Earth will reach the 1.5 degree threshold within a decade. And even if countries were to agree to limit warming to that level, the planet would almost certainly surpass it before the warming reversed, due to the realities of how quickly emissions can be reduced. Passing that target will probably lead to some irreversible changes, such as melted glaciers and species losses. To overshoot the mark by only a small amount, or not at all, requires reducing emissions by about 45 percent relative to 2010 levels by the year 2030. The planet would then be able to reach net zero, when the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere is balanced by the amount removed, by around 2050, the IPCC report notes. To bring warming back down below the 1.5 degree target by the end of the century, the world will need negative emissions technologies to remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Such technologies that limit or even reverse warming are less pie-in-the-sky than they sound, says Stephen Pacala, an ecologist at Princeton University. “Although there is a lot of doom and gloom available on the progress of humanity, there isn’t on the technological side.” Pacala chaired a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine committee that released a report in October that analyzed the viability of current and emerging negative emissions technologies as well as encouraged large-scale investments in them. Some simple negative emissions practices already in use include planting forests to soak up atmospheric carbon, or growing plants for biofuels and then storing underground the CO2 from the burning of those fuels. But current efforts have drawbacks. Planting sufficient forests or biofuel crops “would have a large land footprint,” says economist and IPCC coauthor Sabine Fuss of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin. And that could impact future food availability and biodiversity. Other negative emissions technologies in development could become game changers, Pacala says. Direct air capture, in which CO2 is removed directly from the atmosphere and converted into synthetic fuel, is a proven technology. But so far, the high cost of direct air capture remains a barrier to commercial-scale development. The National Academies report says that nations should subsidize start-ups to drive competition in this area — after all, that’s what worked for wind and solar power, Pacala notes. Other proposed negative emissions technologies, such as converting atmospheric CO2 into a stable mineral form (SN: 9/15/18, p. 9), show some promise but require large-scale financial investment in their basic science to make them viable, the report states. Reducing demand for resource-intensive products will also be important to reach the 1.5 degree target, Fuss says. Cities need to move away from fossil fuels, and individuals can do their part by, for example, traveling less (SN: 6/9/18, p. 5), eating less meat (SN: 7/7/18, p. 10) and installing more energy-efficient appliances. Data show that, given the right incentives, people are willing to make such lifestyle changes, says IPCC report coauthor Linda Steg, an environmental psychologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. And those incentives aren’t necessarily financial or based on self-interest, she adds. “People are also motivated by protecting the interests of others, or by the quality of the environment.” Holding warming to 1.5 degrees “is not impossible,” says Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University and an IPCC report coauthor. But “it really requires ambitious efforts, and the sooner the better. We have to start cutting emissions now.” Political will to act varies country by country, but scientists have done what they can to convey the urgency and the scope of the climate change problem, says IPCC report coauthor Heleen de Coninck, an environmental scientist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands. Nations “have it in their hands, and they know what they are working with,” de Coninck says. “Now it’s up to them.”"
"526","Climate change made the Arctic greener. Now parts of it are turning brown.","Arctic browning could have far-reaching consequences for people and wildlife, affecting habitat and atmospheric carbon uptake as well as increasing wildfire risk.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning","The Chugach people of southern Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula have picked berries for generations. Tart blueberries and sweet, raspberry-like salmonberries — an Alaska favorite — are baked into pies and boiled into jams. But in the summer of 2009, the bushes stayed brown and the berries never came.  For three more years, harvests failed. “It hit the communities very hard,” says Nathan Lojewski, the forestry manager for Chugachmiut, a nonprofit tribal consortium for seven villages in the Chugach region. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The berry bushes had been ravaged by caterpillars of geometrid moths — the Bruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata) and the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata). The insects had laid their eggs in the fall, and as soon as the leaf buds began growing in the spring, the eggs hatched and the inchworms nibbled the stalks bare.  Chugach elders had no traditional knowledge of an outbreak on this scale in the region, even though the insects were known in Alaska. “These berries were incredibly important. There would have been a story, something in the oral history,” Lojewski says. “As far as the tribe was concerned, this had not happened before.” At the peak of the multiyear outbreak, the caterpillars climbed from the berry bushes into trees. The pests munched through foliage from Port Graham, at the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, to Wasilla, north of Anchorage, about 300 kilometers away. In summer, thick brown-gray layers of denuded willows, alders and birches lined the mountainsides above stretches of Sitka spruce.  For more than 35 years, satellites circling the Arctic have detected a “greening” trend in Earth’s northernmost landscapes. Scientists have attributed this verdant flush to more vigorous plant growth and a longer growing season, propelled by higher temperatures that come with climate change. But recently, satellites have been picking up a decline in tundra greenness in some parts of the Arctic. Those areas appear to be “browning.” Like the salmonberry harvesters on the Kenai Peninsula, ecologists working on the ground have witnessed browning up close at field sites across the circumpolar Arctic, from Alaska to Greenland to northern Norway and Sweden. Yet the bushes bereft of berries and the tinder-dry heaths (low-growing shrubland) haven’t always been picked up by the satellites. The low-resolution sensors may have averaged out the mix of dead and living vegetation and failed to detect the browning.  Scientists are left to wonder what is and isn’t being detected, and they’re concerned about the potential impact of not knowing the extent of the browning. If it becomes widespread, Arctic browning could have far-reaching consequences for people and wildlife, affecting habitat and atmospheric carbon uptake and boosting wildfire risk.  The Arctic is warming two to three times as fast as the rest of the planet, with most of the temperature increase occurring in the winter. Alaska, for example, has warmed 2 degrees Celsius since 1949, and winters in some parts of the state, including southcentral Alaska and the Arctic interior, are on average 5 degrees C warmer.  An early effect of the warmer climate was a greener Arctic. More than 20 years ago, researchers used data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s weather satellites to assess a decade of northern plant growth after a century of warming. The team compared different wavelengths of light — red and near-infrared — reflecting off vegetation to calculate the NDVI, the normalized difference vegetation index. Higher NDVI values indicate a greener, more productive landscape. In a single decade — from 1981, when the first satellite was launched, to 1991 — the northern high latitudes had become about 8 percent greener, the researchers reported in 1997 in Nature.  The Arctic ecosystem, once constrained by cool conditions, was stretching beyond its limits. In 1999 and 2000, researchers cataloged the extent and types of vegetation change in parts of northern Alaska using archival photographs taken during oil exploration flyovers between 1948 and 1950. In new images of the same locations, such as the Kugururok River in the Noatak National Preserve, low-lying tundra plants that once grew along the riverside terraces had been replaced by stands of white spruce and green alder shrubs. At some of the study’s 66 locations, shrub-dominated vegetation had doubled its coverage from 10 to 20 percent. Not all areas showed a rise in shrub abundance, but none showed any decrease. In 2003, Howard Epstein, a terrestrial ecologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and colleagues looked to the satellite record, which now held another decade of data. Focusing on Alaska’s North Slope, which lies just beyond the crown of the Brooks Range and extends to the Beaufort Sea, the researchers found that the highest NDVI values, or “peak greenness,” during the growing season had increased nearly 17 percent between 1981 and 2001, in line with the warming trend.  As the Arctic warms up, it’s getting greener, but some pockets have been going brown instead. Satellite imagery and ecologists on the ground have observed browning in the circled areas on this map. Earth-observing satellites have been monitoring the Arctic tundra for almost four decades. In that time, the North Slope, the Canadian low Arctic tundra and eastern Siberia have become especially green, with thicker and taller tundra vegetation and shrubs expanding northward. “If you look at the North Slope of Alaska, if you look at the overall trend, it’s greening like nobody’s business,” says Uma Bhatt, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Yet parts of the Arctic, including the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of western Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (the islands north of the mainland that give Canada its pointed tip) and the northwestern Siberian tundra, show extensive browning over the length of the satellite record, from the early 1980s to 2016. “It could just be a reduction in green vegetation. It doesn’t necessarily mean the widespread death of plants,” Epstein says. Scientists don’t yet know why plant growth there has slowed or reversed — or whether the satellite signal is in some way misleading.  “All the models indicated for a long time that we would expect greening with warmer temperatures and higher productivity in the tundra, so long as it wasn’t limited in some other way, like [by lower] moisture,” says Scott Goetz, an ecologist and remote-sensing specialist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. He is also the science team lead for ABoVE, NASA’s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment, which is tracking ecosystem changes in Alaska and western Canada. “Many of us were quite surprised … that the Arctic was suddenly browning. It’s something we need to resolve.”  While global warming has propelled widespread trends in tundra greening, extreme winter weather can spur local browning events. In recent years, in some parts of the Arctic, extraordinary warm winter weather, sometimes paired with rainfall, has put tundra vegetation under enormous stress and caused plants to lose freeze resistance, dry up or die — and turn brown.  “As an ecologist, you’re thinking, ‘Whoa! Those plants would usually be nicely insulated under the snow,’ ” he says. “Suddenly, they’re being exposed because all the snow has melted. What are the consequences of that?”  Arctic plants survive frigid winters thanks to that blanket of snow and physiological changes, known as freeze resistance, that allow plants to freeze without damage. But once the plants awaken in response to physical cues of spring — warmer weather, longer days — and experience bud burst, they lose that ability to withstand frigid conditions.  Bjerke, Phoenix and other researchers continue to find brown vegetation in the wake of winter warming events. Long periods of mild winter weather have rolled over the Svalbard archipelago, the cluster of islands in the Arctic Ocean between Norway and the North Pole, in the last decade. The snow melted or blew away, exposing the ground-hugging plants. Some became encrusted in ice following a once-unheard-of midwinter rainfall. In 2015, the Arctic bell heather, whose small white flowers brighten Arctic ridges and heaths, were brown that summer, gray the next and then the leaves fell off. “It’s not new that plants can die during mild winters,” Bjerke says. “The new thing is that it is now happening several winters in a row.”  The weather needn’t always be extreme to harm plants in the Arctic. With warmer winters and summers, leaf-eating insects have thrived, defoliating bushes and trees beyond the insects’ usual range. “They’re very visual events,” says Rachael Treharne, an Arctic ecologist who completed her Ph.D. at the University of Sheffield and now works at ClimateCare, a company that helps organizations reduce their climate impact. She remembers being in the middle of an autumnal moth outbreak in northern Sweden one summer. “There were caterpillars crawling all over the plants — and us. We’d wake up with them in our beds.”  In northernmost Norway, Sweden and Finland in the mid-2000s, successive bursts of geometrid moths defoliated 10,000 square kilometers of mountain birch forest — an area roughly the size of Puerto Rico. The outbreak was one of Europe’s most abrupt and large-scale ecosystem disturbances linked to climate change, says Jane Jepsen, an Arctic ecologist at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. The Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. The higher temperatures have led to browning in some areas due to:  Extreme weatherMidwinter warming awakens plants, which then freeze as temperatures dive. Moth infestationsInsects thrive and move into new areas to eat plants. WildfiresDry plants plus more lightning leads to blackened land. “These moth species benefit from a milder winter, spring and summer climate,” Jepsen says. Moth eggs usually die at around -30° C, but warmer winters have allowed more eggs of the native autumnal moth to survive. With warmer springs, the eggs hatch earlier in the year and keep up with the bud burst of the mountain birch trees. Another species — the winter moth (O. brumata), found in southern Norway, Sweden and Finland — expanded northward during the outbreak. The spring and summer warmth favored the larvae, which ate more and grew larger, and the resulting hardier female moths laid more eggs in the fall.  While forests that die off can grow back over several decades, some of these mountain birches may have been hammered too hard, Jepsen says. In some places, the forest has given way to heathland. Ecological transitions like this could be long-lasting or even permanent, she says.  Once rare, wildfires may be one of the north’s main causes of browning. As grasses, shrubs and trees across the region dry up, they are being set aflame with increasing frequency, with fires covering larger areas and leaving behind dark scars. For example, in early 2014 in the Norwegian coastal municipality of Flatanger, sparks from a power line ignited the dry tundra heath, destroying more than 100 wooden buildings in several coastal hamlets.  Sparsely populated places, where lightning is the primary cause of wildfires, are also seeing an uptick in wildfires. Scientists say lightning strikes are becoming more frequent as the planet warms. The number of lightning-sparked fires has risen 2 to 5 percent per year in Canada’s Northwest Territories and Alaska over the last four decades, earth system scientist Sander Veraverbeke of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and his colleagues reported in 2017 in Nature Climate Change. In 2014, the Northwest Territories had 385 fires, which burned 34,000 square kilometers. The next year, 766 fires torched 20,600 square kilometers of the Alaskan interior — accounting for about half the total area burned in the entire United States in 2015.  In the last two years, wildfires sent plumes of smoke aloft in western Greenland (SN: 3/17/18, p. 20) and in the northern reaches of Sweden, Norway and Russia, places where wildfires are uncommon. Wildfire activity within a 30-year period could quadruple in Alaska by 2100, says a 2017 report in Ecography. Veraverbeke expects to see “more fires in the Arctic in the future.”  The loss of wide swaths of plants could have wide-ranging local effects. “These plants are the foundation of the terrestrial Arctic food webs,” says Isla Myers-Smith, a global change ecologist at the University of Edinburgh. The shriveled landscapes can leave rock ptarmigan, for example, which rely heavily on plants, without enough food to eat in the spring. The birds’ predators, such as the arctic fox, may feel the loss the following year.  The effects of browning may be felt beyond the Arctic, which holds about half of the planet’s terrestrial carbon. The boost in tundra greening allows the region to store, or “sink,” more carbon during the growing season. But carbon uptake may slow if browning events continue, as expected in some regions.  Treharne, Phoenix and colleagues reported in February in Global Change Biology that on the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway, extreme winter conditions cut in half the heathlands’ ability to trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the growing season.  Yet there’s still some uncertainty about how these browned tundra ecosystems might change in the long-term. As the land darkens, the surface absorbs more heat and warms up, threatening to thaw the underlying permafrost and accelerate the release of methane and carbon dioxide. Some areas might switch from being carbon sinks to carbon sources, Phoenix warns.  On the other hand, other plant species — with more or less capacity to take up carbon — could move in. “I’m still of the view that [these areas] will go through these short-term events and continue on their trajectory of greater productivity,” Goetz says. The phenomena that cause browning events — extreme winter warming, insect outbreaks, wildfires — are on the rise. But browning events are tough to study, especially in winter, because they’re unpredictable and often occur in hard-to-reach areas.  At a couple of recent workshops on Arctic browning, remote-sensing experts and ecologists tried to tackle the problem. “We’ve been talking about how to bring the two scales together,” Bhatt says. New sensors, more frequent snapshots, better data access and more computing power could help scientists zero in on the extent and severity of browning in the Arctic.  Researchers have begun using Google Earth Engine’s massive collection of satellite data, including Landsat images at a much better resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters per pixel. Improved computational capabilities also enable scientists to explore vegetation change close up. The European Space Agency’s recently launched Sentinel Earth-observing satellites can monitor vegetation growth with a pixel size of 10 meters by 10 meters. Says Myers-Smith: “That’s starting to get to a scale that an ecologist can grapple with.”  This article appears in the April 13, 2019 issue of Science News with the headline, “Arctic Browning: Warming trends bring insects, extreme weather and wildfires to land that had been going green.”"
"527","A mysterious coral disease is ravaging Caribbean reefs","Scientists are racing to learn what’s behind a disease that’s “annihilating” whole coral species in hopes of stopping it.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-coral-disease-ravaging-caribbean-reefs","Divers monitoring coral reefs off St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands in January noticed something alarming: Big white lesions were eating into the colorful tissues of hundreds of stony corals. Some corals were dead by the next day — only their stark white skeletons remained. Others languished for up to two weeks. Within four months, more than half of the reef suffered the same demise. What’s killing the corals is far from clear, but the prime suspect is stony coral tissue loss disease, sometimes referred to by its initials SCTLD or by the nickname “skittle-D.” This infection, discovered off Florida in 2014, is responsible for what some scientists consider one of the deadliest coral disease outbreaks on record. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox In the Caribbean, the disease is now ravaging about a third of the region’s 65 reef-building species, scientists estimate. Yet researchers aren’t even sure if the disease is viral, bacterial or some other microbial mix. Whatever the cause, “it’s annihilating whole species,” says coral ecologist Marilyn Brandt, who is leading a science team trying to tackle the outbreak from multiple research angles. Past outbreaks of other coral diseases near St. Thomas have cut coral cover by up to 50 percent over a year, says Brandt, of the University of the Virgin Islands. But this new disease has done the same amount of damage in half that time — spreading faster and killing more corals than any past outbreaks in the area. “It marches along the reef and rarely leaves corals behind,” Brandt says. “We’re pretty scared.” Stony coral tissue loss disease can kill corals in a matter of days or weeks. Here, a lesion eats away at coral tissue over six weeks. Coral reefs occupy less than 2 percent of the ocean floor. But they play a crucial role in the ecosystem, sustaining an estimated quarter of marine species. Sometimes mistaken for rocks or plants, corals are actually collectives of coral polyps, tiny invertebrates that get sick just like any other animal. Corals sometimes succumb to deadly plagues. Other times, they can shake off milder maladies akin to a common cold.   Since the first coral disease was documented in the 1970s in the Caribbean, researchers have identified dozens more around the world, with the Caribbean now considered a coral disease hot spot. But scientists still know little about these illnesses and how they work. Many marine microbes don’t grow well in petri dishes and test tubes, so studying coral diseases is tough, Brandt says. Even the names given to the diseases are vague, based only on the visual cues of an infection, such as yellow-band disease, dark-spot syndrome and white plague. And it doesn’t help that many look similar.  Stony coral tissue loss disease, which first attacks brain corals before moving on to other stony corals, was initially mistaken for white plague. Off southeast Florida, the outbreak has persisted for five years. In that time, the disease has affected almost all of a 580-kilometer stretch of reef, including the Florida Keys, says marine biologist Karen Neely of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Such a prolonged assault surprised scientists. Coral disease outbreaks typically burn out after a few months. Stony coral tissue loss disease appeared off Florida in 2014 and has since spread across the Caribbean. Cases of the disease have been confirmed (red) on reefs off Mexico, Jamaica, St. Maarten, the Dominican Republic and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Suspected cases are shown in orange. Mapping cases of stony coral tissue loss disease Source: P.R. Kramer, L. Roth and J. Lang/AGRRA 2019 (Data source: AGRRA) Neely and others are trying to save Florida’s reef-building corals by moving hundreds of healthy colonies to tanks, where they can be studied, bred and protected from the outbreak along the coast. Meanwhile, divers slather sick corals left in the reef with a disinfectant and an amoxicillin paste, which seems to heal lesions. Neely estimates that Florida researchers have treated nearly 1,200 colonies since January. With the antibiotic, “we are seeing about 85 percent success,” Neely says. But the medicine doesn’t stop new lesions from popping up. “One of the big priorities is to develop colony level treatments,” she says. Until then, this paste “is the best we can hope for.”   The antibiotic’s effectiveness suggests the disease could be bacterial, Brandt says. But the disease could have viral origins, in which case the paste would be treating a symptom, not the cause. To find out what might be causing the disease, members of Brandt’s team are looking at corals’ microbiomes — the multitudes of microbes that live in and around corals. Building the list of suspects requires first sorting out what normally belongs on healthy corals, and what doesn’t. At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, marine ecologist Amy Apprill and colleagues are scrutinizing the microbiomes of sick corals, as well as sediments and water circulating around the reefs in St. Thomas. Comparing that data with data from Florida corals may uncover similarities between the two outbreaks that can help narrow the list of culprits, Apprill says. The team is also focusing its microscopes on samples of brain and star corals taken just as lesions popped up. Originally from a healthy reef in St. Thomas, the corals caught the disease during an experiment in which they were placed near infected corals from Flat Cay in an aquarium. “We might be getting a look at what ‘early’ disease looks like,” Apprill says, before opportunistic microbes gain a foothold. She doesn’t expect to find a singular pathogen, though. “Many scientists are moving toward this idea that it may be a consortium” of microbes that causes a disease, she says. And that consortium could look different for different coral species and in different environments. But a disease might trigger similar shifts in microbial diversity, so those patterns are something to watch for, Apprill says. New clues about stony coral tissue loss disease are coming from a research team in Florida led by Julie Meyer of the University of Florida in Gainesville. That team found that diseased corals had microbiomes that were more prone to change and become more diverse than their healthy counterparts. Genetic analyses of these microbiomes identified five types of bacteria abundant in corals infected with the disease, the researchers report May 3 at bioRxiv.org. At least one type thrives in low-oxygen conditions that accompany decaying tissue, and all have been linked to other coral disease outbreaks around the world. But more work is needed to determine if the microbes identified are causing the disease, or simply taking advantage of an opportunity to populate the weakened coral. While some researchers hunt for pathogen suspects, coral immunologist Laura Mydlarz and others are investigating what happens to sickened corals at the cellular level. “I’m more on the host side,” trying to figure out why some hard coral species are more vulnerable than others, says Mydlarz, who is part of Brandt’s team. Mydlarz’s lab, at the University of Texas at Arlington, has shown that the immune systems of some susceptible coral species get stuck in cell-death mode, or apoptosis, when tricked into thinking that pathogenic bacteria are invading. These corals slough off their tissue. Species that are more disease-tolerant, however, had immune systems that went into cell-recycling mode and fought off infection, her team reported in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2017. Mydlarz suspects something similar might be happening in corals vulnerable to stony coral tissue loss disease. That’s because the species in her study that favored cell-death mode are among those hit hardest by the outbreak.   This race to learn more about stony coral tissue loss disease and other infections is becoming urgent as climate change warms ocean waters. Global warming is like a one-two punch for coral disease: Heat stress and bleaching may weaken coral defenses, while warming waters send pathogens into overdrive. Pollution, overfishing and other environmental factors can also stress corals, giving pathogens an in. “Coral reefs just can’t catch a break,” Brandt says. “I feel like we’re playing whack-a-mole,” addressing one challenge after another. Oceans are now warming 40 percent faster than what had been predicted in the 2014 report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, according to an analysis published in January in Science. And the trend is expected to continue, as oceans soak up roughly 93 percent of excess atmospheric heat trapped by greenhouse gases. As ocean temperatures rise, coral disease will likely rival bleaching as a major driver of coral decline. Disease outbreaks are expected to become more frequent and more severe, researchers reported in 2015 in Nature Climate Change. Flat Cay reef off St. Thomas had been considered resilient, having rebounded from a major bleaching event in 2005 and back-to-back hurricanes in 2017. But the current outbreak has killed off all of the reef’s maze corals, a type of brain coral. And pillar corals could be next, Brandt says. Stony coral tissue loss disease “seems to be capable of changing the face of coral reefs as we know it.” The researchers are trying to keep up with where and how the disease is spreading. Pathogens may have made their way from Florida to St. Thomas in the ballast water of ships, says coral reef ecologist Dan Holstein of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Stony coral tissue loss disease has also been reported on reefs off the east coast of Mexico, Jamaica, St. Maarten and the Dominican Republic. Holstein is using ocean current data and other factors to forecast where the disease might show up next. Early results suggest that another U.S. Caribbean territory, Puerto Rico, should be worried. Divers in May confirmed that the outbreak is inching toward the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, with star corals about 17 kilometers offshore and 40 meters deep already pocked with white lesions, says Tyler Smith, who oversees the reef monitoring program at the University of the Virgin Islands in St. Thomas. The discovery was disheartening, Smith says. Scientists knew that star corals in shallower waters were susceptible to the disease, but hoped those living in deeper waters might be spared (SN Online: 7/19/18). He likens the deep reefs, made up of hundreds of millions of densely packed colonies, to a powder keg. With deeper star corals also succumbing, “the spread of [the disease] might pick up very rapidly,” Smith says, “even more than it is now.”   Brandt and colleagues are continuing to monitor reefs in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In June, they found a glimmer of hope in waters near St. Croix. None of the 270 sites surveyed around the island showed signs of the disease, though some corals did have the less-severe white plague. “It was a moment of panic,” Brandt says. “Everybody is on high alert.”"
"528","Students worldwide are striking to demand action on climate change","On March 15, students are set to attend more than 1,000 events to demand that governments do more to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/students-worldwide-are-striking-demand-action-climate-change","For the past several months, growing numbers of students around the world have been cutting class — not to play but to protest. The topic driving them is the same: Earth’s changing climate, as evidenced by increasing wildfires and droughts, rising seas and more extreme weather. As the students see it, governments have not done enough to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, to limit global warming or to plan ways to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox On March 15, this student-led protest will crescendo with a coordinated strike set to take place across the globe. More than 1,300 events are planned in 98 countries from Argentina to Vanuatu, according to a list kept by the group Fridays For Future. “These kids speak with a moral clarity and poignancy that none but the most jaded of ears can fail to hear,” says Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State. He says he believes the school-strike movement “is part of why we will soon see a tipping point on climate action here in the U.S. and around the rest of the world.” What motivates Milou Albrecht, 14, of Castlemaine, Australia, who is a coleader of strikes in her country, is worry about wildfires. When she was little, a fire quickly approached the bush country where she was playing at a friend’s house. Smoke filled the air, she recalls, and everyone had to evacuate. “You didn’t know what to take, so we didn’t take anything.” The planet’s average temperature has risen about 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times, according to a 2018 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC (SN: 12/22/18, p. 18). Human-induced global warming already has caused multiple changes in Earth’s climate, the IPCC noted in its report, pointing to more heat waves, more and heavier rains or snow events and a greater risk of drought.  If emissions continue at the current rate, the increase in average global temperatures will hit 1.5 degrees C sometime between 2030 and 2052, the IPCC says. Beyond that point, impacts will be even more severe. And the longer people wait to cut back releases of greenhouse gases, the more difficult it may be. For instance, the longer U.S. auto and energy companies wait, the higher the costs for any action would be, according to an October 2017 study in Environmental Science & Technology. Such data, many students now argue, means the time to act is now. Many young protesters have drawn inspiration from Greta Thunberg, a 16-year old Swedish teen with Asperger’s syndrome. Although this mild form of autism can leave people uncomfortable in social situations, Greta began regularly protesting outside Sweden’s Parliament during the summer of 2018. Her protests inspired the Fridays for Future movement. Greta also has encouraged kids to strike in other countries and spoke to delegates at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC), held in December in Katowice, Poland. “You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes,” Greta testified. There is still time to limit the worst impacts, she noted — but only if governments act now. “Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible,” she said, “there is no hope.” Greta’s message has spread like wildfire. Twelve-year-old Haven Coleman from Denver, a coleader of the U.S. school strikes, was inspired to act by changes she’s seen in her part of the world. “We’re affected by floods and fires, and we’ve been in a 19-year drought,” she says. Climate change will make such events more common and worsen air pollution, especially from wildfires. And that makes it even more personal for Haven: She has asthma, so breathing dirty air already causes her problems. “All ages are welcome for the climate strikes,” says the 22-year-old. “Not being a teen does not stop you from striking for climate.” The impacts of Earth’s changing climate will hit developing countries, like hers, especially hard. Many people there have limited electricity, few government services and low incomes. And residents are more likely to work outside, where they’re subject to extreme heat or other problems. These people also tend to have less money to pay for steps to adapt, such as buying and running an air conditioner. “Climate denialism is like suicide,” Nakate says of the people who argue climate change is not happening. “We cannot let ourselves perish as we look on without doing anything,” she says. “Not taking climate action is like locking yourself up in a house on fire.” If adults are the ones who need to act, why are kids protesting? “It is our generation which has the highest stake in this,” explains 15-year-old Scarlet Possnett, a Suffolk, England, teen who is an organizer of YouthStrike4Climate. A big first step is for governments to recognize climate change as a crisis, she says. And many, seemingly, do not see the urgency, she adds. Just 100 companies across the globe are responsible for 70 percent of the greenhouse gases driving climate change, Possnett notes, citing figures from a 2017 report from CDP, a British group that gathers data on pollution. Those big companies won’t reduce emissions on their own, the teen believes. To prompt them to act, she argues, “there needs to be a policy change.” But, the study points out, these cuts so far “fall a long way short” of achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which most of the world’s nations have pledged to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Doing that will require cutting emissions by roughly 25 percent over the next 10 years, Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia in England and her colleagues reported in Nature Climate Change February 25, 2019. Key to that will be huge moves “to phase out the use of fossil fuels,” the report says. Many young people can hardly remember a time when Earth’s changing climate did not threaten them, says Lilah Williamson. And going forward, “we’re not going to know a time without [its] impending doom,” says this 14-year old from Burnaby, Canada. The region where she lives has suffered from storms that have been dumping heavier rains than in the past. There also have been more droughts and wildfires. “I just can’t imagine what it’s going to be like in the future,” she says. Such students can feel burdened by a type of dread, points out Susie Burke, a psychologist in Castlemaine, Australia, and Milou’s mom. Imagining how climate change will affect them leaves many kids anxious, as well as empathetic toward others suffering from these severe events, she and her colleagues reported May 2018 in Current Psychiatry Reports in a study about the psychological impacts of climate change.   Burke supports her daughter’s protests. School strikes are a “problem-focused” way of coping with climate’s impacts, she says.. “You try to do something about the problem that is causing you stress.” The protests can reassure children and teens that they’re not alone: “Your concerns are shared by a whole bunch of people.” Learning about climate change and its impacts can seem overwhelming, says Milou. But taking part in climate protests has “felt empowering,” inspiring and even fun. And, if the global strike is any indication, getting governments to act on climate change is crucial to the next generation. As Greta told the United Nations meeting, “We have run out of excuses, and we are running out of time.”"

After Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of New Jersey and New York, the superstorm hit Boston near low tide, causing minimal damage. If Sandy had arrived four hours earlier, many Bostonians would have been ankle to hip deep in seawater. Across the globe, sea levels are rising, delivering bigger storm surges and higher tides to coastal cities. In Boston, the most persistent reminder comes in the form of regular “nuisance” flooding — when seawater spills onto roads and sidewalks during high tides. Those nuisance events are harbingers of a wetter future, when extreme high tides are predicted to become a daily occurrence. “The East Coast has been riding a post-Sandy mentality of preparing and responding before the next big one,” says Robert Freudenberg, an environmental planner at the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy firm based in New York City. But a more enduring kind of threat looms. “Sea level rise is the flooding that doesn’t go away,” he says. “Not that far in the future, some of our most developed places may be permanently inundated.” And Boston, for one, is not waiting to get disastrously wet to act. In the seven years since Hurricane Sandy’s close call, the city-run Climate Ready Boston initiative has devised a comprehensive, science-driven master plan to protect infrastructure, property and people from the increasingly inevitable future of storm surges and rising seas. The famously feisty city intends to be ready for the next Sandy as well as the nuisance tides that promise to become the new normal, while other U.S. coastal cities are trying to keep up. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox British colonists founded Boston in 1630 next to a freshwater spring on the heavily forested Shawmut Peninsula. By the 1800s, the trees had been replaced by a bustling trading port. As the population grew, industrious residents began filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks, dirt and trash to create more buildable space. By the early 1900s, the city had tripled in geographic land area. The South End, Charlestown, East Boston, Back Bay and downtown neighborhoods, including attractions like historic Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium, are all built on landfill. Even Logan International Airport is built atop a filled-in tidal flat that was once five islands. Boston’s original coastline (green) includes the Shawmut Peninsula, where the city was founded in 1630. Much of the current city is built on landfill (brown), once marshlands and tidal flats. The Muriel G. and Norman B. Leventhal Family Foundation Of course, early Bostonians had no idea that rising seas would one day threaten former lowlands. With more filled-in land area than most major U.S. cities and 75 kilometers of shoreline, Boston is the fifth most vulnerable coastal city to flooding from sea level rise in the United States — after Miami, New York City, New Orleans and Tampa — and the eighth most vulnerable city in the world, in terms of overall cost of potential damage, according to the World Bank. When it comes to coastal flooding, Boston has a lot stacked against it. The city’s official elevation is 14 meters above sea level, but its lowest areas sit at sea level. Over the last century, sea level in Boston Harbor rose by about 28 centimeters, due to both thermal expansion of seawater as the oceans warm (SN Online: 9/28/18) and the melting of distant ice sheets. Conservative projections for Boston place sea level about 15 centimeters higher by 2030, 33 centimeters higher by 2050 and 149 centimeters higher by 2100. In a worst-case scenario, if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace, sea level could rise by as much as three meters by 2100. New England and the eastern shore of Canada have a unique combination of geographic factors that push water farther inland in response to high tides: The region’s shallow seafloor topography tends to funnel water higher inland, and its proximity to the Gulf Stream — a major ocean current that runs from the Gulf of Mexico up along the East Coast — also helps magnify tides. Due to rising ocean temperatures, the Gulf Stream is slowing down, causing even more water to pile up along the East Coast and boosting high tides, physical oceanographer Tal Ezer of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., reported in June in Earth’s Future. In 2017, Boston racked up a record 22 nuisance tides (defined in Boston as tides over 3.8 meters above average sea level), according to a 2018 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As sea level creeps higher, the Seaport and some other areas of Boston could see daily tidal flooding by mid-century, says Kirk Bosma, a coastal engineer with the Woods Hole Group in Massachusetts. As sea level rises, so does high tide. When storms hit at high tide, the combination of storm surge and high tide is a storm tide. In Boston Harbor, the highest recorded storm tide crested at 4.6 meters above sea level in January 2018, causing extensive flooding. Climate Council of Australia, adapted by T. Tibbitts Flooding during extreme high tides, when there’s no storm in sight, already happens in East Boston, Charlestown and the downtown waterfront (SN Online: 7/15/19). David Cash, an environmental policy expert at the University of Massachusetts Boston, has witnessed high tide flooding from his office overlooking Dorchester Bay and Morrissey Boulevard, a major thoroughfare and the primary road to the campus. “Morrissey Boulevard now floods several times a year at high tide on blue sky days,” Cash says. If a storm hits at high tide, its effects can be greatly magnified, creating a storm tide, Bosma says. Boston lies in the path of both winter nor’easters and Atlantic hurricanes, which are increasing in intensity, NOAA reported in July in an overview of current research on global warming and hurricanes. When storm surges and heavy rain or snow hit coastal cities with more concrete than absorptive marshland, the combination can overwhelm urban drainage systems and cause flooding. The winter of 2018 was stormy, even by New England standards. In January, winter storm Grayson dumped more than 40 centimeters of snow on Boston. Streets were flooded deep enough to float large dumpsters in the dark, icy water. “During the storm, the high tide came right up over the seawall, across the street and poured into my office building’s parking garage,” says Joel Carpenter, an equity trader at Congress Asset Management in the Seaport. As massive plow trucks drove through about a meter of seawater, pushing huge ice chunks out of the way, Carpenter wondered how he would get home. “Public transport was shut down.” He had to walk through ankle-deep water to a spot several blocks from his office, where an Uber was willing to pick him up. When the ocean surged 4.6 meters above the high tide mark, Grayson broke the record set in 1978 for the highest storm tide. Just two months later, in March, winter storm Riley delivered another record storm surge. Like it did in 2012, the city got lucky: Riley didn’t hit at high tide, Bosma says. “If Riley had occurred with hide tide, it would have been disastrous.” As it was, public transportation ground to a halt and the National Guard had to come in to help evacuate stranded motorists and residents. “These storm events are a real wake-up call,” Cash says. “Our future is going to be wet.” By the time those winter storms hit, Boston was already getting serious about protecting itself against flooding. In 2015, officials assembled BRAG, the Boston Research Advisory Group, to bring Boston-based researchers together to guide science-based decision-making for Climate Ready Boston. “BRAG is like a mini Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just for Boston,” says BRAG member Ellen Douglas, a hydrologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. BRAG combines peer-reviewed literature and locally sourced published data to project Boston-specific impacts of heat waves, storms and sea level rise. In 2016, BRAG released its first report, “Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Projections for Boston.” The references run long, citing more than 100 studies. Based on the probabilities of the various sea level rise scenarios outlined in the report, Boston is preparing for up to 100 centimeters of sea level rise. Future zoning and coastal resilience projects — those intended to protect people and keep property from flooding — will need to safeguard against at least 100 centimeters, about a yardstick’s worth, of sea level rise. “We did a full citywide vulnerability assessment [of] how, when and where the city would be affected over different time frames,” using BRAG’s sea level rise estimates, says Bud Ris, a senior member of the Green Ribbon Commission, a consortium of business, institutional and civic leaders that advises Climate Ready Boston. Several Boston neighborhoods and public institutions are on low-lying landfill (left). Climate Ready Boston is preparing the city for about 100 centimeters of sea level rise (right), which will flood several areas (dark blue) if no action is taken. Several Boston neighborhoods and public institutions are on low-lying landfill (top). Climate Ready Boston is preparing the city for about 100 centimeters of sea level rise (bottom), which will flood several areas (dark blue) if no action is taken. Boston is ranked eighth worldwide for expected economic losses due to coastal flooding, estimated at $237 million per year in 2005 and $741 million annually by 2050, according to a 2013 study in Nature Climate Change. “Those kind of numbers frame the upfront costs and the call to action pretty starkly,” Ris says. “If we don’t do the work now, we are going to pay even more later.” The cost of adaptation is daunting; estimates range into the billions of dollars over the next 50 years. In April, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh pledged 10 percent of the city’s $3.49 billion capital budget in 2020 to fund resiliency projects, such as raising major roadways and replacing existing concrete structures and pavement along coastlines with floodable green spaces. Though much more money will be needed, Massachusetts has a history of coming up with funds for staggeringly expensive public works projects, Ris says. Cleaning up the infamously filthy Boston Harbor cost taxpayers about $5 billion over two decades. The city spent $22 billion on the Big Dig, the country’s most expensive highway project that took two decades to reroute the city’s formerly elevated Central Artery into a tunnel system completed in 2007. “If we come up with a workable plan, the money will come from somewhere,” Ris predicts. One of the first steps toward building a more flood-resilient Boston was to map where the water will go, Douglas says. “The first set of maps we put out [in 2011] showed what the coastline of Boston will look like by the year 2100 with sea level rise and a large storm surge. The map got a lot of attention because it was so blue.” With 100 centimeters of sea level rise, much of Boston’s fill land will be inundated by the harbor, returning the remaining landmass to the original shape of the Shawmut Peninsula. Low-lying city landmarks such as North Station, Faneuil Hall and the aquarium would be permanently awash in blue. The Boston Harbor Flood Risk model, released in 2015, shows how flooding in and around Boston Harbor will change over time under various scenarios. “We looked at thousands of different [historical and simulated] storm events combined with sea level rise, waves and tides, and determined the movement of floodwaters out of the harbor and into the streets,” says Bosma, who led the modeling project. The model identified the financial district, Fort Point Channel and the Blackstone Block Historic District as among the city’s most vulnerable areas. “If you just look at the 2100 maps, [preparing for flooding] can seem pretty hopeless,” Bosma admits. “But the models show where we need to focus our money and efforts right now and where we can plan for future projects in 2030, 2050 and beyond.” The city government has also been working on making more detailed street-by-street maps of Boston’s many neighborhoods, says Carl Spector, Boston’s commissioner of the Environment Department. “We started with East Boston and Charlestown, because they are already seeing flooding,” he says. That report was released in 2017, followed by a report for South Boston in 2018. The city is now evaluating the downtown and North End districts. “These reports have priority lists and recommended timelines for when projects should be started and completed over the next 30 years,” Spector says. Protecting individual buildings from flooding usually involves waterproofing lower floors, raising electrical equipment and installing pumps to remove floodwater. But on a citywide scale, flood protection starts at the coastline. The most efficient way to prioritize resiliency projects is by focusing on efforts that can protect entire neighborhoods, rather than single buildings, Bosma says. “Boston is not flat; it actually has quite a bit of topography that directs water in certain ways. We look to the coast and try to come up with more regional solutions — whether that be a floodwall or a berm or a park — that can protect a whole slew of inland assets all at once.” So why not build a concrete seawall around Boston Harbor to protect the entire city? BRAG and the Sustainable Solutions Lab at the University of Massachusetts analyzed the feasibility of installing a pair of barriers across the harbor. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense from both financial and operational standpoints,” Bosma says. A permanent barrier would cost as much as $20 billion and require intensive maintenance. Plus it could limit the size and frequency of ships coming and going from the harbor as well as impede the flow of water needed to maintain water quality. Building a dynamic harbor barrier, with gates that open and close to allow for shipping and water flow, is feasible from an engineering standpoint, Bosma says. But by 2040 or 2050, sea level will probably be high enough that such gates would need to be closed for almost every high tide to prevent flooding. “The size and magnitude of the gates required would take six to eight hours to open or close,” he says. “They’d have to be almost constantly moving.” Shore-based solutions that buffer against high tides and storm surges make more sense, the analysis found. Nature-based coastal adaptations such as parks and wetlands that can absorb the flooding are not only effective but also bring added benefits such as native habitat restoration, tourism and recreational opportunities, according to a study conducted on the Gulf Coast and published in 2018 in PLOS ONE. “As much as possible, we’re using nature-based solutions that are flexible and can be adjusted over time to conditions depending on what happens with sea level rise,” Bosma says. Resilience is about more than keeping buildings dry. “We may be able to protect Boston’s buildings, but if people can’t turn on the lights and can’t flush the toilets and they can’t get to work via public transportation and they can’t call for help because the phones don’t work, we’re going to be in deep trouble,” says John Cleveland, executive director of the Green Ribbon Commission. Outages in the power grid, as well as telecommunications, water and gas services — which rely on the power grid — can cascade inland to places that never actually get wet, says Rae Zimmerman, an urban infrastructure planner at New York University. For convenience, fiber optics, gas mains, water mains and electric power distribution lines often share the same underground conduits. “It’s cheaper to install and maintain them that way, but it also means that when one system goes haywire, they all go,” Zimmerman says.  Climate Ready Boston is behind in this arena. “As far as I know, the city hasn’t started coordinating its strategy around its infrastructure for transportation, energy, water, wastewater and communications,” Bosma says. “We need to be embedding resilient design standards into ongoing infrastructure investments.” For example, when the city overhauled its stormwater and wastewater sewer systems 30 years ago, “we didn’t foresee the problem of sea level rise,” says John Sullivan, chief engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. During flood events, partially shared wastewater and stormwater drainage systems make keeping seawater out of Boston’s wastewater treatment plants a challenge. The city is now researching strategies for storing influxes of stormwater using existing natural depressions in the landscape and even parking garages, so that saltwater does not get into the wastewater treatment plants and wreak havoc on the microbes that help process the waste. One goal is to incorporate backup systems that flow with gravity and don’t require pumping. “If we can avoid having to pump, which requires electricity, we’ll be better off in the event of a power outage,” Sullivan says. Last summer, a team led by computer scientist Paul Barford of the University of Wisconsin–Madison released a series of maps that overlapped the physical internet — fiber-optic cables, hubs and data centers — with projections of sea level rise in major U.S. coastal cities. Just like with the water systems, nobody was thinking seriously about sea level rise when the infrastructure that runs with the internet was installed 20 years ago, Barford says. “Now we have thousands of miles of cables and major data centers that are susceptible to damage during coastal flooding events.” Waterproofing vulnerable components of the physical internet may help, but the most critical infrastructure may need to be moved inland away from the coasts, he says. Pipes, conduits and power lines follow existing roadways, so some utilities may be able to piggyback on the maps and strategies developed for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Douglas says.  Boston is fifth among the U.S. cities most at risk for coastal flooding, but when it comes to preparation, how do other coastal centers stack up?  “MassDOT has taken all of our reports very seriously,” she says. “They have a lot of infrastructure in the way of sea level rise.” Perhaps the biggest challenge is to keep the Big Dig highways open for traffic while protecting the tunnels from flooding, Douglas says. “You can’t just close off the tunnels. They are important evacuation routes during emergencies, but they were not built to tolerate any amount of flooding.” Not so long ago, sea level rise was considered a distant problem, something to deal with a hundred years or more from now. But sea level rise is already lapping at U.S. shores. Boston may be among the oldest cities in the country, but it also might prove to be one of the most resilient. The Climate Ready Boston plan is well under way, with completed district-level projects in East Boston, Charlestown and South Boston. Work includes installing a deployable floodwall along the East Boston Greenway, elevating a section of Main Street in Charlestown to protect a large swath of the neighborhood and removing concrete to restore floodable parks and green space in South Boston and the Seaport. With momentum building in Boston, the resiliency project is expanding to the rest of the state; Massachusetts has over 300 kilometers of coastline to protect, including the curled arm of Cape Cod. This spring, Massachusetts Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo and Governor Charlie Baker each pledged $1 billion in grants for resilient infrastructure and climate adaptation projects across the state. When it comes to implementing climate adaptation strategies, other cities, including New York, can learn from Boston, says Freudenberg, the environmental planner in New York. “Developing a vision for climate adaptation is easy. Implementing that vision is much harder,” he says. “At some point, once we’ve considered the science and all the available strategies, we have to start building. It’s been seven years since Sandy and seas are rising. It’s time to take action.”"
"532","Public trust that scientists work for the good of society is growing","More Americans trust the motives of scientists than of journalists or politicians.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/public-trust-scientists-work-good-society-growing","These days, it can seem as if science is under assault. Climatologists are routinely questioned about what’s really causing global warming. Doctors can be disparaged for trying to vaccinate children against disease. But for the U.S. public at large, scientists are generally seen as a trustworthy bunch. In fact, 86 percent of Americans hold at least “a fair amount” of confidence that scientists work for the public good,  according to a survey released August 2 by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox That’s far better than how respondents felt about what motivates politicians (only 35 percent said they were fairly confident that elected officials acted in the public interest), journalists (47 percent) or even religious leaders (57 percent). And that general trust in the goodwill of scientists has grown steadily over the last four years, from 76 percent in 2016. But confidence falters on narrower questions of scientists’ trustworthiness. For instance: “The issue of trust in scientists is part of a broader conversation that society is having on the role and value of experts,” says Cary Funk, the director of Pew’s science and society research. “What we wanted to do was get a look at the potential sources of mistrust.” Conducted from January 7 to January 21, the survey questioned 4,464 randomly selected adults who are demographically representative of the U.S. population, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. It focused on three scientific fields: medicine, nutrition and environment. But it did not look at specific topics that have become highly politicized, for example, childhood vaccination campaigns (SN: 6/8/19, p. 16) or climate change (SN Online: 7/28/17). When it comes to overall confidence that professionals act in the public good, scientists scored the highest among respondents, followed closely by the military. Trust in the motivations of journalists and politicians trailed, by comparison.  T. Tibbitts Source: Pew Research Center Survey 2019 The growing trust in scientists is “really great to see,” says Jacob Carter, a research scientist for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. But the fact that so few people had faith in scientific transparency and accountability was “a bit disheartening to me as a scientist,” he says. There are systems in place to prevent scientific misconduct and penalties “if, for example, you’re caught plagiarizing or fabricating results,” he says. The introduction in March of congressional legislation called the Scientific Integrity Act marks a positive step toward building public trust in science, Carter says. The bill aims to prevent political interference in scientific policy and to allow government scientists to share research with the public, among other things. The survey also found that 60 percent of Americans believes scientists deserve a place in debates over crafting science policy — though that result reveals a partisan divide. Among Democrats, 73 percent wanted scientists at the table in policy discussions, but that fell to 43 percent among Republicans. Still, those numbers are encouraging, especially in a national survey covering all 50 U.S. states, says Max Boykoff, director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. “Empowering scientists to step into these [policy] arenas is great,” he says. “Certain kinds of advocacy, I would argue, are part of their responsibility: advocacy for facts, empirical evidence, solid methodologies.” Overall, scientists have been more willing to step into the public arena in recent years. Thousands of scientists and science advocates joined the first annual March for Science in 2017 in Washington, D.C. (SN Online: 4/22/17). Journalists have become more interested in covering science stories, and social media is carrying messages further across society. Boykoff noted that younger scientists especially have been open to speaking about their work, which has helped to make science more accessible to the public. And, in fact, the survey found that people overall were more trusting of research in areas that they were more familiar with. Two other key factors boosted confidence, too: whether research data was made publicly accessible and whether findings were reviewed by scientific peers. “Trust is important to legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness,” Boykoff says. “Without trust, scientists would just be screaming into the wind.”"
"533","New research may upend what we know about how tornadoes form","New data on the birth of tornadoes suggest that the twisters don’t form from the top down.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-research-may-upend-what-we-know-about-how-tornadoes-form","WASHINGTON — Tornadoes may form from the ground up, rather than the top down.  That could sound counterintuitive. Many people may picture a funnel cloud emerging from the bottom of a dark mass of thunderstorms and then extending to the ground, atmospheric scientist Jana Houser said December 13 in a news conference at the American Geophysical Union meeting. Scientists have long debated where the wind rotations that lead to twisters in these thunderstorms begin. Now Houser, of Ohio University in Athens, and her colleagues have new data that upend this “top-down” idea of tornadogenesis. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The supercell thunderstorms that can spawn tornadoes form where a powerful updraft of warm, moist air — such as air moving northward from the Gulf of Mexico — gets trapped beneath a layer of colder, drier air — such as air moving southward from Canada. That’s an inherently unstable condition, but the other necessary ingredient for tornadoes to form is wind shear: fast-moving winds that move the air masses, causing them to rotate horizontally. Air then rising through the supercell can tip the rotation from horizontal to vertical — creating conditions ripe for a tornado. But the very moment of twister birth remains largely elusive. Tornadoes can form within just 30 to 90 seconds, so research on how they start is often limited by not quite getting to the right place at the right time to watch a twister actually being born — and her team was no exception, Houser said. But using a rapid-scanning Doppler radar mounted at the back of a truck, the team managed to capture the full evolution of four tornadoes, including two powerful twisters that struck near El Reno, Okla., one on May 24, 2011, and another on May 31, 2013. The radar, which collects data every 16 seconds, showed that rotating winds for the 2011 storm appeared to start at multiple levels in the atmosphere at once, rather than starting high up and moving downward. For the 2013 storm, tornado-strength rotation actually began at the lowest measured elevation, about 20 meters above the ground. By 60 seconds later, the rotation was at a height of about 3.5 kilometers. Crowdsourced still and video images of the El Reno storm also revealed a funnel near the ground — even before the radar was able to capture it. Houser team’s discovery that the 2013 storm had a funnel long before the radar saw rotation is “a pretty compelling finding,” says Leigh Orf, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. But, he says, that twister was such a particularly “unusual, rare, weird, bizarre storm” that he would hesitate to use it as an indicator of typical tornado behavior. “In my scientific view, there are likely different modes of tornadogenesis,” Orf says. He notes that his own simulations of the 2011 storm match Houser’s finding that that particular tornado seemed to develop rapidly spinning winds at multiple altitudes at once. Forecasters typically scan supercell thunderstorms, looking for telltale signs that a tornado might be imminent. Because the deadly funnel clouds form so quickly, understanding how tornadoes form is important — and increasingly so in the United States where tornadoes appear to be becoming more powerful. These twisters are also staying on the ground, on average, for more time than they did just a few decades ago. That gives tornadoes more time to do damage, James Elsner, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State University in Tallahassee, reported in a separate study at the meeting. In that study, also published November 10 at EarthArXiv.org, Elsner calculated that the overall power in gigawatts released by tornadoes in the United States has increased, at a rate of about 5.5 percent per year. Using a statistical model for tornado power, based on reports of nearly 28,000 tornadoes from 1994 to 2016, he found that although the overall number of tornadoes hasn’t increased, the twisters are forming in bigger bunches. In these clusters, there is a higher proportion of tornadoes rated at the highest intensities, such as EF4 or EF5 tornadoes. That shift, Elsner says, is linked to rising ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and the western Caribbean Sea. With more heat and moisture available in the atmosphere due to global warming, tornadoes, perhaps not surprisingly, can pack a more powerful punch, he says."

Yet climate scientists continually wrestle with how best to talk about these issues: Should discussions of climate change appeal directly to people’s emotions, whether fear or anger or even hope? Or are data-driven discussions the way to go? There is no one answer, of course. But The Human Element, a documentary starring photographer James Balog, aims directly for the gut by putting a human face on the impacts. The movie, now streaming online, shows how human-caused climate change is intersecting with people’s lives. For instance, we see flooded homes in Florida in the wake of Hurricane Irma in 2017. Global warming probably increased Irma’s intense rainfall, researchers have found. We also see firefighters battling wildfires in the American West (the movie is almost entirely shot in the United States). “I felt a great sense of urgency to bear witness,” Balog says in the film. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox That collision of people and planet is something that Balog, also the subject of the 2012 documentary Chasing Ice, has been capturing in photographs for decades. In The Human Element, his work is framed through the four ancient elements: earth, air, fire and water. People, Balog suggests, are a fifth element — a force of nature, too. People are driving climate change, and their lives are being altered by it. It is in showing the faces of those directly affected by our tampering with nature that the movie packs its most powerful punches. After capturing the desolation of a family standing in knee-deep water inside their home in Irma’s aftermath, the film shows other water-related impacts, particularly the plight of the residents of Tangier Island in Virginia, which is being rapidly and inexorably swallowed by the rising waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The air segment focuses on how humans are altering the atmosphere, specifically with such pollution as volatile organic compounds emitted by planes, cars, trucks and facilities that process oil and gas. One heart-wrenching scene takes Balog to a school in Denver that specializes in treating kids with asthma, a condition often triggered by pollution. The kids are trained to treat themselves during an asthma attack; many do so several times a day. In the fire segment, Balog photographs firefighters as they wearily but valiantly tackle the 2016 Soberanes Fire near Big Sur, Calif. With a price tag of $260 million, the blaze is among the most expensive ever battled in the United States. In the film, geographer Tania Schoennagel of the University of Colorado Boulder notes that climate change, as well as the increasing encroachment of human communities into former wilderness (SN: 12/22/18 & 1/5/19, p. 8), is already transforming the wildfire season. Since the 1970s, she says, there has been a 1,000 percent increase in the frequency of megafires — fires burning at least 40,000 hectares — in parts of the western United States. Finally, the earth segment brings Balog to the coal-mining country of Kentucky and Pennsylvania — where, he says, “what we’ve dug from the Earth and burned has changed the other ‘elements.’ ” Balog, whose grandfather died while mining coal, paints a grim picture of how a fading industry with dwindling jobs has left former miners in dire straits. But the segment ends on a rare note of hope — and offers the film’s only nod at climate mitigation efforts. Balog follows a pair of developers who are planning to build a massive solar energy farm on reclaimed coal-mining land in hopes of bringing new jobs to the impoverished area. The Human Element also doesn’t dwell for long on actual climate science, though the scientists who appear throughout provide helpful context for each of the movie’s segments. What the film does do, and does well, is tell a series of human stories, accompanied by Balog’s haunting photos. The combination of stories and images is indeed an effective, powerful way to communicate the impacts of climate change. FORCE OF NATURE  Watch the trailer for The Human Element."
"537","What happens when the Bering Sea’s ice disappears?","Record-low sea ice in 2018 sent ripples through the Bering Sea’s entire ecosystem. Will this be the region’s new normal?","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bering-sea-ice-disappearing-arctic-ecosystems","Peggy’s data were a bit of a shock. From an anchored vantage point in an expanse of the southeastern Bering Sea west of Alaska, Peggy, or mooring M2, had monitored conditions in the water for 25 years. A line of sensors extended down more than 70 meters to where Peggy was tethered to the seafloor, collecting information on temperature, salinity and other properties of the water. Most years, the waxing and waning of floating sea ice follows a consistent seasonal pattern that is reflected in Peggy’s data. By November, sea ice migrates in through the Bering Strait or forms in some parts of the Bering Sea. As a by-product of the sea ice formation, a large mass of cold, salty water begins to pool near the seafloor. In the spring, phytoplankton bloom, and by early summer, the sea ice begins to melt away. The cold pool, however, lingers through the summer. With an average temperature just below zero degrees Celsius — a few degrees colder than the surrounding water — that deep, cold pool is central to the Bering Sea ecosystem. The cold pool is where Arctic cod take refuge, hiding from predators such as Pacific cod and pollock, which are less tolerant of the cold. The Arctic cod get fat on large, shrimp-like copepods and spawn their young. In turn, the fish keep polar bears and seals well-fed. But in the winter of 2017–2018, the sea ice never appeared. And Peggy’s data, along with that of other moorings, revealed that the cold pool was AWOL too. Alarm trickled through the ocean science community, researchers who study everything from the physics of the Bering Sea to the small creatures that live on the seafloor and the larger marine mammals at the top of the food chain. In December in Washington, D.C., at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting, these researchers gathered to present their data, trade stories and ponder what it all means. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Were these findings a fluke? “We don’t yet have enough data” to say whether the Bering Sea is increasingly likely to be ice-free, says Jacqueline Grebmeier, a biological oceanographer at the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science in Solomons. But Grebmeier, who has studied seafloor life in the Arctic for more than 30 years, has “a gut feeling,” she says, that it’s not a one-off incident. “I think it’s the beginning of change.” If last year’s events represent a new normal for the Bering Sea (and the very low sea ice extent as of February this year signals they might), then a cascade of changes are in store for the complicated ecosystem that has long thrived in those waters — and for the fishing and tourism industries that rely on the area’s bounty. At their closest point, Alaska and Russia are separated by the 82-kilometer-wide Bering Strait. To the north of the strait lies the Chukchi Sea, on the edge of the Arctic Ocean; to the south is the Bering Sea, extending down to Alaska’s outflung arm of islands, the Aleutians. In the summer, the Bering Sea is largely ice-free, but in winter, ice forms in the northern Bering Sea, or migrates southward through the strait from the Chukchi. The waters reach “freeze-up” when there is at least 20 percent ice cover, scientists say. There were early signs that conditions in 2017 and 2018 were going to be different. By November 2017, the sea ice was already late. The air above the waves wasn’t especially warm. In fact, the air temperature was typical for that time of year, Phyllis Stabeno, a physical oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, reported at the December meeting. But an unusually persistent wind was blowing from the south, she said, preventing the ice from drifting down from the Chukchi Sea as it would normally. The wind tapered off by December and January, but by then air temperatures were higher than normal. The Chukchi Sea, normally at least 80 percent covered by thick, tough, icebreaker-testing pack ice by January, still had large open swaths of water. That meant less ice was available to migrate southward through the Bering Strait. Temperatures near the seafloor in the northern Bering Sea tend to hover around -1.5° Celsius in July, forming a “cold pool.” But in 2018, the average bottom water temperature was about 1.5°, signaling the absence of a cold pool that year. No data were collected in July 2009.  Summer temperatures near the northern Bering Sea floor Mooring M8, about 800 kilometers northwest of Peggy, had never recorded so little ice in the winter. M8, taking measurements since 2008, registered temperatures just above the seafloor that were more than 3 degrees C above normal. And Peggy, down by the Aleutians, had never recorded higher summertime water temperatures near the seafloor. That summer, the water never dropped below freezing. Then, in February, the strong southerly winds began again, and the unusual wind direction persisted through March; scientists suspect those winds kept the Chukchi Sea unusually warm, by pushing warmer waters from the Bering Sea northward. The warmer waters also prevented the formation of sea ice. The ice that did form in the Chukchi and Bering seas was thin and easily pushed back northward by the prevailing winds. Sea ice, whether migrating in or forming in place, is an anchoring part of the Bering Sea ecosystem. The ice helps determine when and where food becomes available to creatures living in the water or on the seafloor. As the migrating sea ice travels south, it melts. That meltwater is relatively fresh and less dense than the surrounding water. As a result, the waters become stratified, with the layer of fresher water staying on top. That freshwater, full of nutrients, helps give rise to the southern Bering Sea’s springtime phytoplankton blooms, which in turn feed copepods and other small floating creatures. When the phytoplankton eventually die and sink to the seafloor, they provide an important food source for creatures living on the bottom. But the absence of sea ice means that the water doesn’t stratify until later in the spring, and so the phytoplankton blooms happen later in the spring. Not every Bering Sea dweller will be quick to adjust to those delays in the ecosystem’s food web. “The timing is important,” Grebmeier says. “It’s a question of how fast [the animals] can adapt.” And thanks to the winds and warmth, little sea ice managed to form within the Bering Sea, which meant no deep, cold pool near the seafloor. Normally, the cold pool forms as a by-product of sea ice formation, especially in a region just south of St. Lawrence Island. Prevailing winds blowing south from the island create a space of open water called a polynya that freezes quickly in winter. As quickly as the ice forms, the winds blow it away from the island, opening up the water again to more freezing, creating a sea ice production line. All of that ice forming at that one spot pulls a lot of freshwater out of the sea; the water that’s left behind is salty and dense and sinks down to the seafloor, forming that pond of cold water that lingers throughout the summer. Although the dramatic absence of sea ice last winter was startling, waters in the Arctic have actually been on a decades-long warming trend. In the southern Chukchi Sea, freeze-up has happened about half a day later each year since 1981, Stabeno and colleagues reported in November in Deep-Sea Research. And in the northern Bering Sea, mooring M8’s data show particularly stark changes over the last four years. From 1981 to 2014, freeze-up happened on average by the end of December. But since 2014, freeze-up hasn’t occurred until January or February — or, in 2018, not at all. This warming trend has had trickle-down effects on the seafloor dwellers. Species such as bivalves that once carpeted the seafloor surrounding St. Lawrence Island, to the south of the strait, have shifted northward, Grebmeier says. In 2010, Grebmeier helped establish the Distributed Biological Observatory, an international effort to monitor long-term ecosystem changes in the Arctic by visiting designated “hot spots” year after year in the region, including the Bering and Chukchi seas. Those sites include the region just south of St. Lawrence Island, where the cold pool usually forms. Bivalves on the seafloor there used to provide a nutritious, fatty food for walruses and seals. And spectacled eiders — a kind of sea duck — dove for the mollusks, using the sea ice as a safe, stable launch pad. But over time, those bivalve patches have given way to marine worms, a far less nourishing food, Grebmeier says. For spectacled eiders, which are considered at risk of extinction in the near future, the food shift and the loss of sea ice is a one-two punch. “It takes less energy to sit on the ice and feed on underlying prey than to swim,” she says. “So the impact on these organisms is dramatic.” Other creatures in the Arctic have taken a hit as well. Researchers have measured an increase in the populations of small copepods that tiny larval pollock eat. But populations of fattier and more nourishing large copepods are in decline, which is bad news for juvenile fish that need the larger copepods to survive through the winter. The prey changes have had cascading impacts on the food web: Changes in the distribution and types of fish populations have spelled doom for thousands of seabirds. Last summer was the third year in a row with a massive seabird die-off, Calvin Mordy, a biological oceanographer with NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, reported at the December meeting. The seabirds showed evidence of starvation, he said, not disease. 2018’s record-setting low sea ice in the northern Bering Sea and a missing cold pool in the southern Bering took a toll on some species. Blue king crabs, ribbon seals and krill have decreased. Small copepods and urchins fared better. The combination of wind and warmth that led to the record-low sea ice in the Bering Sea, scientists say, was unusual based on past records. The question is how typical these conditions will be in the future, Stabeno says. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, with an average temperature about 1.7 degrees C above the long-term average during 1981 to 2000, according to the 2018 Arctic Report Card, NOAA’s annual report on the state of the Arctic. In fact, the five years since 2014 are the five warmest scientists have ever measured, says Emily Osborne, the lead editor of the 2018 report card and a climate scientist with NOAA’s Arctic Research Program in Silver Spring, Md. Last year was the second-warmest year on record, exceeded only by 2016, she says. One visible effect of the temperature rise is a sharp decline in summer sea ice cover, with the last 12 years being the 12 lowest on record. Rising air and ocean temperatures aren’t the only sign of change in the Arctic Ocean. The runoff from local rivers is having an impact. “It’s the most land-dominated ocean in the world,” says Karen Frey, a polar scientist at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “It’s a dumping ground for everything,” she adds, from sediment loads carried by rivers to dissolved organic matter to phytoplankton. “All roads lead to the Arctic.” In 2018, the volume of discharge of the eight largest rivers emptying into the Arctic Ocean was about 20 percent higher than it was in the 1980s, due to some combination of factors related to global warming, including increasing degradation of permafrost and increasing rainfall in the High Arctic. All of that material pouring into the ocean has resulted in a heightened supply of nutrients. The extra nutrients plus the warmer waters and more sunlight shining through — thanks to the missing or thinner sea ice — add up to larger phytoplankton blooms, Frey says. Some of that algal biomass — scientists don’t yet know how much — is toxic, akin to the deadly red tides blossoming along Florida’s coasts in recent years (SN: 9/29/18, p. 14). Such toxins can kill fish, as well as produce neurological damage in humans. Paralytic shellfish poisoning has increased seven-fold among Alaskans over the last 40 years, with the rise possibly caused by an increase in harmful algal blooms, Frey says. The state now has one of the highest incidences of shellfish poisoning in the world. The frequency and distribution of harmful algal blooms have both increased dramatically in recent years, prompting the first special section on harmful algal blooms included in the 2018 Arctic Report Card. The culprit algae may have “been present in many areas at low levels that wouldn’t be harmful. But the minute you start warming seawater … and removing sea ice, they adjust,” Frey says. “We are just starting to make measurements of harmful algal blooms and starting to understand how those species in the Arctic respond to light. It’s a very new question that has yet to be answered.” Frey, as part of the Distributed Biological Observatory program, visited the Bering Sea last July to measure how less sea ice, as well as thinner sea ice, changes the amount of light that reaches the waters to encourage blooms. Even the thinner ice — often covered with small melt ponds — could have a big effect on how much light penetrates, she found. The melt ponds “are basically skylights” for the waters below, she says. Having melt ponds on the surface of the sea ice can increase transmission of light into the water from perhaps 10 percent to as much as 60 or even 70 percent, Frey reported at the December meeting. The increase in phytoplankton blooms was particularly dramatic in 2018, the report card notes. Less sea ice and more melt ponds meant more light penetrated the Arctic’s waters earlier in the year, prompting blooms in the northern Bering Sea even as the south bloomed later. The northern waters, which normally see blooms in May, bloomed as early as March. The amount of algal biomass in March was about 275 percent higher than the average March biomass for 2003 to 2017. Scientists are still studying how much the harmful algal blooms may have contributed to excess seabird deaths. Bloom-related toxins have been implicated in other wildlife mass mortality events in the last few years, from walrus to seals to whales — animals that probably ate contaminated fish and shellfish, just like humans, the Arctic Report Card notes. As warming waters and decreasing ice cover create ever more favorable conditions for all algal blooms, the threat of harmful toxins will almost certainly contribute to economic losses for two of the region’s biggest industries: fishing and tourism. “Historically we shouldn’t be seeing another year like [2018], but under that argument, this year shouldn’t have happened,” Stabeno said in December. “What we saw this year was predicted to happen in 2050,” she added. “This gives us a view of the future.”"
"538","As waters rise, coastal megacities like Mumbai face catastrophe","For coastal megacities like Mumbai, rising seas and weather chaos linked with climate change threaten economic and social disaster.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-rise-coastal-megacities-mumbai-face-catastrophe","Each year when the monsoon rain sheets down and the tides swell over coastal Mumbai, Saif shutters his soda shop on Juhu Beach and takes shelter up in the rafters. Still, the water invades through the roof and over the concrete floors, sometimes reaching as high as the freezers full of ice cream. For 36-year-old Saif, the coastal megacity’s chronic flooding is stressful. “What would happen if too much water comes?” asks Saif, who, like many in India, goes by one name. “I could get swept up with it.” Last year’s torrential floods killed at least 14 people in Mumbai. And in July 2005, when a meter of rain fell in a single day, flooding cost the city about $1.7 billion in damages. Rebuilding his uninsured shop after the 2005 floods cost Saif about $57,000. He was lucky. When those floodwaters receded after two days, more than 1,000 people had died from drowning, landslides or other flood-related accidents in Mumbai and surrounding areas. “What can we do?” Saif asks. “Who can win against nature?” Such questions are becoming more urgent in coastal cities at mounting risk of climate-driven flooding. Climate change is raising sea levels, while also making storms more severe and bringing heavier rains to some places. For densely populated cities like Mumbai — the financial heart of India, which is the world’s fastest-growing major economy — those risks threaten to throw personal incomes and national economies into chaos. “The challenge is getting people to prepare for a risk they can’t yet see,” says Stéphane Hallegatte, lead economist at the World Bank’s Global Facility or Disaster Reduction and Recovery in Washington, D.C. “A very tiny change in sea level can have an enormous impact on risk levels,” he adds. By 2005, coastal city flooding cost the world an average of $6 billion a year, according to calculations by Hallegatte and colleagues. Even if humankind manages to limit the release of carbon dioxide enough to keep global warming to an average 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — which is highly unlikely — seas will still rise by a global average of about 20 centimeters by 2050, if not more. That’s enough to more than double the frequency of flooding in the tropics, where Mumbai is located, according to a 2017 paper in Scientific Reports. Global losses from coastal flooding may surpass $1 trillion annually by 2050 unless coastal cities prepare, Hallegatte’s team says. That projection is actually conservative, because it doesn’t include damage from other climate-related flood risks such as heavier rains and stronger storms (SN: 6/27/15, p. 9). Last year, Hurricane Harvey’s extreme rainfall, probably fueled by climate change, caused $125 billion in flood losses in Houston (SN: 1/20/18, p. 6). And in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Hurricane Maria caused $90 billion in damages, mostly from winds. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox If cities invest enough to just hold steady at their current level of flood risk, future losses would drop drastically, to about $60 billion per year, Hallegatte says. Mumbai’s share would be about $6.4 billion — making it the second-most economically vulnerable city after China’s Guangzhou. Many of Asia’s fast-growing coastal megacities, with populations of 10 million or more, are vulnerable to multiple flood threats. Mumbai, the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka and Manila in the Philippines, among others, face a future of heavier rainfall and higher storm surges. Manila and others, like Indonesia’s Jakarta, are also sinking fast. Some spots in Jakarta are sinking at a rate of 20 to 28 centimeters a year. “For an individual, it doesn’t matter if the water is coming from sea rise or a storm surge or the clouds, a flood is a flood,” Hallegatte says. “Cities should be looking … at one-meter sea level rise, at least. Because the cost of failure is so big, you need to have a plan for the worst-case scenario.” Mumbai and other fast-growing coastal megacities in Asia are particularly vulnerable to climate-related flooding. Twenty-one of the world’s 31 megacities hug a coastline, 13 of which are in Asia. These cities of 10 million or more often drive their national economies and are home to both rich and poor. As the world’s population balloons, two more Asian coastal cities will be pushed into the mega zone by 2030: Bangkok and Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City, according to United Nations estimates. In addition to flooding, these megalopolises could face water supply disruptions, dangerous heat waves (SN: 4/14/18, p. 18), increased food insecurity and more disease outbreaks. On a Sunday evening in June, the promenade along Mumbai’s iconic Marine Drive is packed. Families stroll eating ice cream, children chase street vendors peddling cotton candy, and friends squeeze together for selfies framed against the blue-gray waters of the Arabian Sea. Dark, roiling monsoon clouds loom over the horizon, as waves crash a meter away against the concrete barricade. The promenade was built a century ago when India was part of the colonial British Empire. The walkway’s days may be numbered. Mumbai’s coastal waters rose at least nine centimeters during the 20th century, according to tide gauge data. Today, seawater regularly spills over the promenade during high tide. It’s not clear how much farther seas will rise around Mumbai. A variety of factors, including tides, gravity and Earth’s rotation, influence local area sea rise in complex ways. And a lack of detailed data on Mumbai’s coastal geography available to scientists leaves questions on how future local water levels will affect specific areas of the city. The state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, acknowledged this data deficit in its 2014 climate change plan. Nevertheless, the state has so far ignored a 2017 Indian Supreme Court order to release maps demarcating future flood lines. Maharashtra’s environment secretary, Anil Diggikar, told Science News that the mapping is being done, though he did not say when the maps might be made public. But the state does recommend that rainfall and sea level trends be considered in new construction projects and public infrastructure. “This is especially important for [the] economic hub of Mumbai and surrounding districts,” he says, while also touting plans for restoring coastal stands of protective mangrove trees. Marine scientist Mani Murali of the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa, India, has tried to work out Mumbai’s future flood risk using low-resolution 2011 topographic data from NASA. That work, under peer review, doesn’t tell the detailed story he knows the city needs. “But I thought something is better than nothing.” He may have a point, with the rate of global sea rise fast accelerating — from a yearly average of 1.8 millimeters in the last century to about 3.0 millimeters per year today, according to a report in the Feb. 27 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Global sea level rise could be kept to a lower projection range (blue) if humankind curbs greenhouse gas emissions. Today, the world is on track for a much higher level of rise (tan).  C. Chang Source: IPCC 2014 And while global sea level projections up to 2050 are considered reliable, the situation beyond midcentury is less clear. Much depends on whether humankind can limit global emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping atmospheric gases. Princeton University climatologist Michael Oppenheimer is not optimistic. “This is a battle that we are currently losing,” says Oppenheimer, a coordinating lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report on oceans, cryosphere and climate change, due out in September 2019. “Sea level rise and the flood heights are only going to increase …for the foreseeable future.” The annual monsoon, the seasonal shift in winds that brings flooding rains to Mumbai, adds an extra layer of uncertainty to projecting how much flooding will accompany sea rise, he says. The future of this South Asian weather system has been difficult to predict, thanks in part to the mysterious influence of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. It’s Earth’s largest region of warm surface seawaters spanning the midocean region between the western Pacific and the eastern Indian oceans. That warmth partly fuels monsoon storm clouds. Still, most studies suggest that the monsoon rains will increase. “Uncertainty is not an excuse [for inaction] at this point,” Oppenheimer says. “People need to get moving.” Lakshmi Murali lives with her husband and son in a quiet, gated community, lush with jackfruit trees and flowering hibiscus in Mumbai’s flood-prone neighborhood of Andheri. Every June, as the rain starts falling, she unplugs the electronics in their ground floor apartment and moves her silk saris out from under the bed. Across the city, the rains rage against the glass windows of luxury high-rises. Public transportation and street commerce come to a halt. Water pounds the tin roofs of slum shanties where about half of Mumbai’s 21.4 million people live. A sewage-tainted slurry burbles out of the city’s outdated and often-clogged drainage system, backing up into rivers and creeks that then overflow into homes and businesses. Last year was particularly bad: In 24 hours, about 33 centimeters of rain fell. “You had to see it to believe it,” says Murali, a 54-year-old lawyer who is not related to the marine researcher of the same name. Her building’s plumbing system failed, and the toilets overflowed. Residents turned off their power for fear of getting electrocuted. As water rose inside their homes, Murali and a few neighbors used an iron rod to smash a hole through the wall surrounding their backyard to let the water flow out. “Today, we are young, and we say, ‘Yeah, it’s OK,’ ” Murali says. Even as such flooding worsens, she has what some might call misplaced faith that things will work out. “The state will work on building enough infrastructure to keep the city alive and will not allow the city to drown. Man will work against what nature is proposing to do.” Mumbai’s current predicament is partly due to the power of engineering over nature. Large parts of the city are built on land that, 300 years ago, was mostly underwater. When the Portuguese settled the region in the 16th century, they maintained Mumbai as a sleepy collection of coastal islands. But the British, who took over in 1661, reimagined Mumbai as a contiguous landmass and created a peninsula by filling in land gaps to connect the islands even in the wet season. Much of Mumbai is built atop landfill (black) that connects several islands (green) in the middle of Bombay Harbor. Those passages once allowed water to flow through the system at high tide and during monsoon rains.  Source: T. Riding/J. Hist. Geography 2018 “So many of these megacities are built on land that is only artificially higher than sea level, in places where landfilling took place,” says Washington D.C.–based Susmita Dasgupta, the lead environmental economist for the World Bank’s Development Research Group. Dasgupta was involved in the World Bank’s first report in 2007 on how sea level rise might affect national economies. The aim was to trigger discussion and preparation for a possible future economic catastrophe. She and her team offered guarded impact estimates based on hypothetical scenarios of between one and five meters of global sea level rise, using satellite images of coastal outlines and local elevations. In estimating potential economic losses, the team considered an affected area’s population multiplied by the country’s gross domestic product per capita, but not infrastructure or property assets. That report projected that one meter of sea rise would cost the world 1.3 percent of the global economy. Applied to the forecast global GDP for 2018, that comes to about $1.3 trillion, not far from the estimates by Hallegatte’s team. “But we wanted to raise the issue,” Dasgupta says. She faced a wave of hostility and derision for the effort. “Even bank colleagues were unhappy about it, saying we were being alarmist and that this kind of research was premature.” Eleven years later, no one doubts the sea is rising. Amid the confusing tumble of scientific studies on how climate change might raise flood risks, some scientists have built online visual apps to help the public understand what’s at stake. One tool, by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows past global sea level trends based on tide gauges. But the app does not give projections. And it relies on sometimes patchy data. For example, there are no readings for Mumbai’s water levels from 1994 to 2005 or after 2010. The Maharashtra government says local sea levels are rising 1.2 millimeters a year, based on those incomplete data. In 2017, a team from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, launched an app to demonstrate how melting ice sheets would affect 293 major port cities across the globe. The scientists measured the melt using NASA’s GRACE satellites, which detect gravity changes from the ice loss. To boost accuracy, the team recently added a component to the app that accounts for the fact that water expands as it warms. Still, true sea level rise projections involve complex computer modeling of overlapping systems. The JPL app doesn’t do that. “So it’s risky” to put too much stock in the numbers it spits out, says JPL sea level and ice supervisor Eric Larour. “But the real risk is that people underestimate that this is going to get worse.” For Mumbai, the JPL app foresees at least another 2.9-centimeter rise in coastal water in 10 years — and 14.4 centimeters in the next 50 years. Those estimates could soon be revised upward. Larour’s team plans one more update to include research published in the June 13 Nature showing that Antarctic ice sheets are melting three times as fast as they were 25 years ago (SN: 6/7/18, p. 6). That much melting, Larour says, is “a big, big deal.” The JPL team hopes to have a single, detailed modeling app for the world within two years, using NASA’s high-resolution satellite images of water levels and of land gradients, “so that people can use it in active mitigation policy,” Larour says. “A lot of areas at risk in South Asia — India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka — and across Asia don’t have the information to do this.” It’s not easy to find a coastal megacity taking decisive and effective action against future flood risks. Bangladesh has long built coastal sea walls of stacked mud, which may help prevent ocean storm surges from cascading inland to Dhaka. Fast-sinking Jakarta is working on its own giant sea wall as well. But walls won’t help Mumbai; they would prevent rain-driven freshwater floods from draining out after the monsoon. Massive structural engineering is not the answer. Many scientists suggest that cities lighten their burden on the land by maintaining natural coastlines, protecting sand dunes and preserving forests or even growing more of them. At the least, cities should refrain from making development decisions that will make things worse, such as paving over water-absorbent soils or building on natural floodplains. Governments can also improve storm drains, offer voluntary relocation packages or even consider introducing ferries rather than trying to raise or maintain existing roads. “We need to evolve to a situation where we’re more congruent with nature, rather than fighting it,” says urban planning expert Amrita Daniere of the University of Toronto, codirector of the Urban Climate Resilience in South East Asia Partnership. The group is aiding flood-preparation efforts in so-called second-tier cities, each still home to millions of people. “It’s too difficult to influence policy and practice in a megacity,” she says. There are cities like Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, that may be just too vulnerable. Built atop an estuary feeding into the Gulf of Thailand, the city — also sinking — is on track to go mega by 2030. “It wouldn’t shock me if they had to move the capital in 20 years,” Daniere says. Cities that don’t own up to their vulnerability risk squandering economic gains made in the last few decades, economists say. Some cities could face a financial reckoning even before flooding worsens. The mere notion of increasing risk is enough to spook investors. “That could have a domino effect on other cities, with bigger consequences for the global financial system,” says Gregory Unruh, an expert in sustainable business strategy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Yet modeling economic consequences is daunting, he says. These trends “tend to be based more on perceptions, on understanding bubbles and behavioral economics.” Pressure is mounting for cities to disclose climate risks. Credit rating agencies including Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have begun including climate change impacts in their assessments. Last year, the Financial Stability Board of the Group of Twenty international forum urged insurers, banks and institutional investors to release climate-related financial risk disclosures. Still, “there’s not much happening,” says Richard Hewston, a climate change analyst at Verisk Maplecroft in Bath, England, which advises on the risks of doing business around the world. “Sea rise is a gradual threat,” even though it can worsen events like tropical cyclones, Hewston says. So it’s difficult for people to use sea level rise as a reason to spend billions of dollars on infrastructure to prevent disaster. Mumbai’s flood risk makes the city a “high risk” place for climate change vulnerability — the second-most worrying category after “extreme risk,” according to Verisk Maplecroft’s 2018 hazard index. Among the world’s 31 megacities, Mumbai ranks as the ninth riskiest, based on about 50 factors ranging from preparedness to exposure to climate shocks like heat waves, drought, hurricanes and flooding. Mumbai’s high population density, high poverty rates and poor sewage and drainage systems “heighten the risk posed by climate-related events like flooding,” the company says. Verisk Maplecroft suggests that Mumbai build better sewage and drainage capacity, halt building on landfill and restore coastal mangrove trees, which keep the land intact with their tangle of roots and act as a natural buffer against the Arabian Sea. There is little evidence that any of that, beyond mangrove restoration, is being done. Drainage system upgrades have been stalled for years. Limits on building on floodplains are routinely ignored. Mumbai-based environmental economist Archana Patankar worries that these are signs of official neglect. Mumbai “is an extremely important city in terms of the economic wealth it generates,” says Patankar. The city’s economy rivals that of some developed nations in Europe. Its stock exchange is valued at around $2.2 trillion — almost twice the entire GDP of Mexico or Australia. Its Hindi-language Bollywood entertainment industry generates billions of dollars in global revenues each year. Not enough work has been done to assess how the city’s economy will be impacted, she says. Read more about how the impact of global sea level rise varies regionally. Alfaproxima/iStockphoto Instead, Mumbai appears focused on further developing its fragile coastline. The government is barreling ahead with plans for a 29-kilometer coastal highway, which will require ripping out patches of protective mangrove trees. Construction cranes punctuate the shoreline as new high-rises go up every year. Property developers are aware of sea level rise, but they’re in the business to sell. “No developer in Mumbai does any kind of risk analysis on how sea level and climate change is going to factor into their risks,” says Rohitashwa Poddar, managing director of local developer Poddar Housing and Development. Though his company aims to build future-proof homes by placing them on stilts or surrounding them with water-absorbing gardens, few of Poddar’s customers ask about flood risk. “People should know if they’re buying property in high-risk areas,” adds Stalin Dayanand, director of Vanashakti, the local environmental group that argued in the Indian Supreme Court for the release of the state’s forecast maps showing “hazard lines” for where the coast might be located in 100 years. The state missed the Supreme Court’s April deadline. Meanwhile, authorities moved ahead with plans for a $409 million memorial statue of the 17th century Indian ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji to be built on landfill in the middle of Mumbai’s bay. If projections are even close to correct, that 200-meter-tall statue could be left towering over a city swamped within decades."

Sheesh, I thought, do I really look like an old lady in need of assistance? When I got off the train, I swear my knees felt a bit creaky as I clomped up the subway steps. When we’re busy doing things we love — which for me these days means playing with my two young granddaughters — we don’t think about how old we are or the state of our knees. But then something pulls us up short, like a polite young man offering his seat, or catching a view of a selfie from an unflattering angle, and suddenly we’re walking more slowly, feeling just a little worse about life in general. The way these internalized attitudes about aging affect us physically is a focus within a growing field in social psychology known as mind-body studies. In the next few months, the World Health Organization is expected to publish the results of a global investigation of ageism — discrimination toward the aged, akin to racism and sexism — that will address how to fight the prejudice. The report will also outline the myriad ways that ageist attitudes can affect the health and well-being of older people. Psychologist Becca Levy is a contributor to the forthcoming WHO report and has spent her career linking negative aging attitudes to such measures as walking speed in older people, a greater likelihood of developing the brain changes of Alzheimer’s disease and even a reduction in life span. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox But it’s not all grim; Levy, at the Yale School of Public Health, has also shown that something as simple as subliminal exposure to age-positive words can lead to physical improvements in older people of the sort that typically come about only after a program of regular exercise. If Levy and other scientists are correct, putting a more positive spin on our general view of aging might make a profound difference in the health of people over 65, the fastest-growing age group in America today. It seems almost too good to be true to think that a simple shift in mind-set could make a serious dent in the $702 billion spent annually on Medicare, 90 percent of which is for older people with multiple chronic diseases. But that’s what some of the most surprising mind-body findings suggest: A more positive attitude toward aging leads to improvements in older people’s memory, gait, balance, speed and a quality that Levy refers to as “will to live.” The terms below were used to test the impact of positive and negative stereotypes on memory in older people.

Levy/J. of Personality and Social Psychol. 1996 Levy began research in this field during graduate school in the 1990s, when she first assessed the physical impact of ageism using a technique she called “age-stereotype activation.” She wanted to test the hypothesis that holding ageist attitudes might be a literal health hazard for older people. First she recruited a couple dozen people of all ages living near Harvard University, where she was studying social psychology, to brainstorm words that represented positive and negative stereotypes of old age. “Decrepit, ” “incompetent” and “decline” were among the 12 they settled on as both relevant to aging and negative; “accomplished” and “sage” were among the 12 deemed both relevant to aging and positive. Then she brought into her lab 90 adults ages 60 to 90 — three-quarters from the Boston metro area, one-quarter from rural Vermont — and randomly assigned them to be exposed to either the negative or positive terms, interspersed with a few neutral words like “between.” “We put them in front of a computer and flashed the words at the level of perception without awareness,” Levy says, describing the technique she also used 20 years later for her study using age-positive words as therapy. The words flashed so quickly on the screen that they appeared only as a blur. This well-tested “semantic priming” technique operated below the level of consciousness to get the subject thinking of aging in a particular way, as either a benefit or burden. “I designed that method after reading about research that was done activating race stereotypes,” she says. In race relations, the technique, which has been the subject of some controversy (SN: 4/22/06, p. 250), has been used to identify an underlying prejudice known as “implicit bias.” When applied to older people, implicit bias has a particularly cruel twist: If you live long enough, it becomes prejudice against a group you now belong to. Levy was interested in whether this prejudice, which pervades so much of Western culture, would eventually have physical effects on an older person’s aging body. Subjects exposed subliminally to negative age stereotypes showed a decline in performance compared with their results on earlier memory tests (taken right before exposure to the loaded words), Levy found. Those exposed subliminally to positive age stereotypes showed an improvement. The biggest negative effects of the downer words were in tests of immediate recall (an average drop of 1.77 points, on a 7-point scale) and delayed recall (down 1.11 points on a 7-point scale). The biggest improvements in the positive-bias group were in tests of immediate recall (an average increase of 0.98 points on a 7-point scale) and photo recall (up 1.4 points on an 8-point scale). When she wrote up her findings in 1996 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Levy offered two ways of looking at these results. The pessimistic view was that “the stereotype that memory decline is inevitable can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.” But the optimistic reading was that memory decline is not inevitable. “In fact,” she wrote, “the studies show that memory performance can be enhanced in old age<U+2009>…<U+2009>as the consequence of a brief priming intervention.” In Western culture, the most deeply held aging stereotypes tend to be the negative ones. Levy and a grad student in computational linguistics, Reuben Ng, now at the National University of Singapore, did a linguistic analysis of 400 million words in written material collected from the past 200 years. The words describing older people grew progressively more negative over time, the two reported with colleagues in 2015 in PLOS ONE. As aging became seen as a medical problem and the proportion of the population over age 65 grew, both changes were “significantly associated with the increase in negative age stereotypes,” the researchers wrote. “The upward trajectory of age-stereotype negativity makes a case for remedial action on a societal level.” Words used to describe older people, found in a database of historical American English, have become increasingly negative in the past 200 years, possibly because aging has come to be seen as a medical condition.  Source: R. Ng et al/PLOS ONE 2015 These negative views of aging can have pernicious physical effects. In 2002 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Levy and colleagues published an analysis of data from the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement. Of 660 subjects over age 50 who had been followed for more than 20 years, those with the most negative attitude toward aging when the study began died at an average age that was 7.5 years younger than those with the most positive attitudes. A German study attempting to suss out the true direction of this relationship concluded that belief in age stereotypes was a more accurate predictor of health than the other way around. The researchers reported in 2007 in the Journals of Gerontology, Series B that it wasn’t that people had positive views of aging because they were healthy; they were healthy because they had positive views of aging.  The preponderance of research evidence, collected over a decade and a half, is what gave Levy the more recent idea to turn age-stereotype activation into an actual treatment. Levy suspected the treatment — exposing older people to positive age-related words — would work best when done on a subliminal level, rather than via cheery self-talk or other explicit reinforcement. When presented beneath the level of consciousness, she believed, positive age stereotypes could overturn long-held ageist beliefs that the mind tries to hold on to. She and colleagues recruited 100 individuals, ages 61 to 99, who received one of four “treatments” once a week for four weeks. The “implicit stereotype” treatment involved sitting at computers and being exposed subliminally to positive aging stereotypes using the same priming technique Levy had used in her grad school experiment; the “implicit control” treatment involved subliminal exposure to random strings of letters. The “explicit stereotype” treatment asked participants to imagine and then write about “a senior citizen who is mentally and physically healthy”; the “explicit control” condition had them write about a neutral topic, like the uniforms people wear to work. Three weeks after the treatments ended, the subjects came back. As Levy reported in 2014 in Psychological Science, exposure to positive stereotypes had a lasting positive impact, and implicit exposure worked better than explicit exposure. The investigators measured balance, walking speed and the ability to get into and out of a chair. Low scores on these measures, Levy and colleagues wrote, mean a higher risk for disability, nursing home placement and earlier death. The subjects in both the “implicit stereotype” and “implicit control” group had scores close to 7 out of 12 on the physical function test the week before the intervention started. In the three weeks following the intervention, the implicit exposure group saw statistically significant improvements. In contrast, the implicit control group made almost no change from the first measurement to the last. Flashing positive words about aging on a screen — too fast to read — in four weekly sessions improved perceptions of aging and physical function in people 61 and older. People who got scrambled letters saw little change. Source: B. Levy et al/Psychol. Science 2014 Not only did the effects seem to last, but they were more robust than those seen in a comparable group of older people who were given an in-home exercise program for six months. Levy and colleagues wrote that they seemed to have created “an implicit fitness center” for older people. Levy’s work builds on the work of her mentor, Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer, who has been examining the theory of mind-body unity since the late 1970s, when she conducted the audacious “counterclockwise study.” In 1979, Langer housed 17 men in their early 70s in a former monastery in New Hampshire for five days. She told the men they would spend that time thinking about what their lives had been like in 1959, when they were in their 50s; she also told them she expected those recollections to have a salutary effect. “It was all about the mind-body connection,” Langer told me recently by phone. Her hypothesis was that “if you take the mind and put it back in time, the body follows suit.” What Langer didn’t tell the participants was that there would be two groups operating under slightly different conditions. For half of the men, the experience would consist solely of remembrance — talking about what things were like in 1959, but from the perspective of the current date, 1979. For the other half, the men were told not only to remember 1959, but to pretend it was 1959. For both groups, the living quarters were outfitted with historical cues — furniture, home appliances, newspaper headlines, reports on the radio — to evoke the world of 20 years earlier. (Significantly, all mirrors were removed.) The only difference was that for the time capsule group, when they talked about that time period, they were urged to use the present tense. The men in the time capsule group had daily sessions talking about news events — Castro attacking Cuba, a Soviet rocketship reaching the moon, the Colts winning the NFL championship — as if they were happening right then. (The control group discussed the same events, but in the past tense.) Like the control group men, the time capsule group watched The Ed Sullivan Show on a black-and-white television and listened to Nat King Cole and Perry Como on a vintage radio — but this group discussed those shows as though they had just been aired. At the end of five days, the men in the time capsule group had lower blood pressure, stronger hand grip, better hearing and vision and fewer aches and pains than they had at the outset. It wasn’t just the result of being at a nice retreat for five days, since the men in the control group improved, too, but not to nearly the same extent. In the time capsule group, finger length — an indication of joint flexibility — increased in three of the eight men. In the control group, one in three men had a decrease in finger length. Langer never submitted her study to a professional journal; she thought it was too small, not to mention too radical. But she did write it up in Higher Stages of Human Development, a peer-reviewed volume she coedited for Oxford University Press in 1990. “The mind and body are one,” Langer says. “We all have far more control over our health and well-being than we realize.” In the years since, Langer has conducted dozens more studies that demonstrate the mind-body connection. In one, known as the “chambermaid study,” Langer and coauthor Alia Crum asked 84 hotel maids whether they exercised. Every one said not really. Langer and Crum then told half the volunteers that their jobs actually were exercise, and that making beds, for instance, was no different from working out at the gym. For the other half, the scientists made no attempt to reframe how the maids viewed their daily activity levels. (For unexplained reasons, the maids in the experimental group turned out to be younger than the controls, with average ages of 34 and 42, respectively.) As Langer and Crum, now at Stanford University, reported in 2007 in Psychological Science, that single change — encouraging the chambermaids to think of their jobs as exercise — made a big difference. With no change in anyone’s actual activity levels or food intake, the maids in the control group were virtually the same at the four-week follow-up, while those in the experimental group had lost weight (1.78 pounds on average), showed a decrease in waist-to-hip ratio, had a lower body mass index (a drop from an average of 26.05 to 25.70) and had a drop in blood pressure from an average of 130/80 to 120/75. The only difference between the two groups — other than the age difference, which the authors said they controlled for in their analysis — was a change of mind-set. When one group of hotel maids was told their work counts as exercise and a control group was not, the “informed” group experienced a change in perception, along with a drop in body weight and blood pressure after four weeks, even though their behaviors didn’t change. Source: A.J. Crum and E. Langer/Psychol. Science 2007 When it comes to aging, even the changes that seem most harshly and immutably physiological, like the plaques of Alzheimer’s disease, have been linked to attitude. In the long-running Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, for instance, attitudes toward aging appeared to make a difference in what happened to the brains of the participants, who were all dementia-free when the study began. People who had more negative views of aging at the outset had a significantly greater buildup, measured postmortem, of the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are the markers of Alzheimer’s, compared with those who had more positive attitudes at the outset. Those with negative views also had more shrinkage in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center. Some scientists worry about the true direction of the relationship between negative attitudes toward aging and health. “It’s hard to tease things out,” says Laura L. Carstensen, director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. “It’s hard to be sure that it’s not some third variable” that accounts for the link between better attitudes and better outcomes. For instance, she says, “it’s a highly replicated finding that positive emotional experience is related to longer life expectancy.” But might some other factor be causing the negative attitude — maybe an underlying illness that researchers are missing — that confuses the direction of cause and effect? The number of Alzheimer’s disease markers (tangles and plaques) were greater in autopsied brains of people who had held more negative stereotypes about aging.  Source: B. Levy et al/Psychol. Aging 2016 “When you’re in good physical health, you tend to be happier,” Carstensen says. So maybe the healthiest older people, who will live longest precisely because they’re healthiest, also happen to have the best attitude toward aging, rather than the other way around. “It always gnaws away at me that there might be some relatively subtle physical vulnerability under way that we’re not picking up,” she says. Many carefully designed studies, including her own, have found a connection between positive attitude and longevity even after correcting for confounding factors such as health. In fact, as she wrote in a 2019 review article in Cognition and Emotion, recent work has uncovered what she calls a “positivity effect” — the preference, as we age, to accentuate the positive, as revealed in age-related shifts in the emotional content of what people remember, what images catch their attention and how they interpret ambiguous social situations. Still, she frets that even the best-intentioned investigators might be missing something in their older subjects. “I’d put my money less on attitude and more on problem-solving,” she says — even though problem-solving and attitude are in many ways intertwined. If an older person’s knee starts hurting, someone with a negative view of aging is likely to think she just has to learn to live with it. The problem-solving kicks in only for people who don’t see age as one unremitting, inevitable decline — age-positive people like Carstensen herself. “If my knee isn’t doing well,” she says, “I call my trainer and he has me start doing different stretches.” Another concern is the one attached recently to the research methodology at the heart of some of these studies: psychological priming (SN: 5/19/12, p. 26). While Levy’s studies involve subliminal exposure to priming cues, some of the limitations of studies involving more explicit forms of psychological priming — having subjects hold a hot coffee mug to elicit warm and fuzzy feelings, for instance — might also apply to some of her findings about ageism. One salient point, according to Levy, is that stereotypes about aging are so pervasive. They can easily be assimilated “from the surrounding culture,” become part of an individual’s self-definition, and ultimately affect how that person’s body operates — a process she describes as “stereotype embodiment.” The process has four components, she explained in 2009 in Current Directions in Psychological Science: The stereotypes become internalized across one’s life span, can operate without us realizing, gain salience as they become relevant to our own situation and use multiple cognitive pathways to gain a hold. Her bottom line: Aging itself is, in part, a social construct. A few months ago, I had another subway encounter that made me feel a lot better about what it means to be older. I was coming home from dinner with a friend, wearing my vintage patterned winter coat, black cowboy boots and a funky herring-bone pocketbook with bright coral straps. As I stepped off the train and started to pull on my periwinkle gloves, a college-aged woman approached. “You look great,” she said. “I love your style. It’s just what I aspire to when<U+2009>…” Her voice trailed off. She seemed embarrassed that she’d planned to end that sentence with “when I’m your age.” But the fact that she had seen me as old was actually the point; the view of aging she invoked was a positive one. I told her she had made my night, and I found myself sprinting up the stairs and walking home briskly, happy to be some young stranger’s inspiration for a cool and lively old age. It suddenly felt possible that I could stay nimble, both mentally and physically, no matter how old I got."

Here are our predictions","From black hole insights to the future of self-driving cars to figuring out what it means to be human, 2019 will be a big year in science.","https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-science-stories-2019-predictions-2018-yir","Entire disciplines are devoted to predicting the future. Trained forecasters use data, trends, human behavior and more to predict what lies ahead. Exactly no one at Science News is a quantitative forecaster or futurist. But we do hear what scientists are buzzing about at meetings, on social media and while reporting stories. So when we asked our writers to predict the big science stories of 2019, each person brought well-informed insights, with a dash of optimism (and sometimes pessimism), to the task. Here’s what they had to say. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox This first set feels a bit like cheating: Some already scheduled happenings will no doubt lead to big findings. The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, starts its third observing run in February. With upgrades, LIGO may detect many more black hole mergers than it saw in past runs, astronomy writer Lisa Grossman says. And our moon will get a lot of traffic in 2019, she adds. China expects to land the first sample-return mission on the moon since 1976 (SN: 11/24/18, p. 14). India will head to the moon’s south pole. And the Israeli company SpaceIL will send its own spacecraft. Grossman and physics writer Emily Conover also put their money on 2019 as the year we finally get a glimpse of a black hole – if the Event Horizon Telescope captures Sagittarius A* , the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Our prediction that the telescope would capture that prize as early as 2017 was a tad premature. Meanwhile, the Parker Solar Probe, which launched in August, will fly close to the sun in April and in September to yield never-before-seen details about our star (SN: 7/21/18, p. 12). In 2019, the Parker Solar Probe will make two of its planned 24 orbits of the sun.  Bruce Bower, who covers behavioral sciences and human evolution, went meta with his main prediction. “Scientific focus will intensify on what it means to be human, and how evolution produced us,” he says. When did the current set of human characteristics emerge? How about the mental capacity of modern people? Did interbreeding with other Homo species play a role? “Anthropologists, archaeologists and geneticists will all weigh in,” Bower says. Our brains are one thing that makes us human, and neuroscience writer Laura Sanders predicts that in 2019, scientists will finally figure out the purpose of the claustrum. This paper-thin sheet covers the insular cortex, a brain structure involved in emotional processing. The claustrum was once theorized to be the seat of human consciousness. “This is one of the most mysterious parts of the human brain,” Sanders says. The 2017-2018 flu season was harsh, causing 80,000 U.S. deaths and sending some 900,000 people to the hospital (SN Online: 9/27/18). Biomedical writer Aimee Cunningham wonders if 2019 will be the year for a universal flu vaccine (SN: 10/28/17, p. 18). She also predicts we’ll see ramped up production of cell-based vaccines, which are reportedly 20 percent more effective than widely used vaccines grown in chicken eggs.   We’ve started a handful of stories with “ultracold superconductors are heating up.” We’ll be saying it again in 2019, Conover says. She reported in September that lanthanum-hydrogen compounds under pressure showed signs of superconductivity — transmitting electricity without resistance — at 215 kelvins (-58° Celsius) to 280 kelvins (about 7° C), the warmest temperatures yet for superconductivity (SN: 10/13/18, p. 6). If those results hold up, the compounds will set the record for the highest temperature superconductor. Conover will also be watching how work unfolds on layered graphene, which may show a type of superconductivity seen in other materials that scientists still can’t explain, she says (SN: 3/31/18, p. 13). On to our gloomy predictions. Technology writer Maria Temming expects there will be more accidents involving self-driving cars in 2019 — because there will be more self-driving cars on the road from companies such as Waymo and General Motors (SN Online: 3/19/18). New safety standards may not require driverless vehicles to have steering wheels, mirrors or pedals. A hands-off setup would make it difficult — or impossible — for a person to take control if something goes wrong.   Regulatory agencies will keep busy in 2019. Staff writer Laurel Hamers has her eye on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, chemicals used in nonstick coatings and firefighting foams that have become persistent contaminants of U.S. water sources (SN: 11/24/18, p. 18). “It’s a topic area to watch, both research-wise and regulations-wise,” Hamers says. Regulatory groups have their eye on the gene-editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 as well. In 2018, the European Union set stringent rules on gene-edited crops. Will other countries follow? And what will be the fallout of the explosive announcement that gene-edited babies were born in China? Molecular biology writer Tina Hesman Saey wants to know. Climate change will continue to be a big story. As earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling noted in our top story of 2018 (SN: 12/22/18 & 1/5/29, p. 18), the last year has brought studies connecting climate change to extreme events such as Hurricane Florence and Asia’s 2016 heat wave. These climate attribution studies will become more common, she predicts. To slow climate change and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels will require technology that can remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the air. “I’m predicting that research on this will kick into high gear,” Gramling says. “Or maybe I’m just hoping.”"

That discovery ranks among our Top 10 partly because it’s just cool, but also because it raises the tantalizing prospect of solving a scientific mystery: Did the impact kick the planet into a roughly 1,000-year cold snap, called the Younger Dryas, almost 13,000 years ago? Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox The mammoths and other species that died out by the end of that period didn’t see climate change coming. But we can. That’s why human-driven climate change is our top story of the year. The rising tide of attribution studies shows that climbing temperatures are already turning extreme events, such as Hurricane Florence, more extreme. This year’s barrage of climate reports gave us a clearer picture of how climate change will affect Earth in the near future — fueling wildfires, sparking heat waves, raising sea levels —and how human actions to curb warming can have an impact. 2018 is also the year a Chinese researcher made the startling claim that he had created the first babies to be born with an edited gene. The ensuing uproar over the controversial birth of twin girls in China, whose genes were allegedly tweaked to reduce their risk of contracting HIV, is sure to have a lasting impact on the future of gene-editing technology. Two other genetics stories made our Top 10. Genetic genealogy is shaking up the field of forensics, ID’ing suspects in cold cases while raising privacy issues. And in a lab experiment, a gene drive — a genetic tool designed to be inherited by 100 percent of offspring — wiped out a population of mosquitoes. That feat ushers in the enticing but perilous possibility of both eliminating certain diseases and deliberately driving a species to extinction. Other stories rounding out our Top 10 examine issues close to home (how to sort through conflicting advice about drinking alcohol) and very far away (tracing a high-energy neutrino back to its source in a distant galaxy).
